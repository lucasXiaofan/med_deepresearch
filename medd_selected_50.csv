Case number 19172,2025/6/9,https://www.eurorad.org/case/19172,A 27-year-old nulliparous female came for her first antenatal scan at 32 weeks of gestation with no prior early antenatal scans. She presented with a bilobed abdominal contour seen externally as two distinct bulges with a central vertical depression. No earlier imaging had been done.,"An ultrasound examination revealed a thin central septum partially dividing the uterus into two hemicavities. The amniotic sac was seen occupying both the uterine hemicavities. The foetus was viable, with the foetal abdomen and lower extremities seen in the right hemicavity, and the foetal head and upper extremities extending into the left hemicavity across the central septum (Figures 1 and 2). Nearly two-thirds of the placenta was implanted on the left side of the central septum, with the rest of it implanted on the anterior wall of the left hemicavity (Figure 3). No vascularity was detected in the uterine septum on Doppler ultrasound.","BackgroundA uterine septum is a congenital M邦llerian anomaly where a fibrous or fibromuscular band divides the endometrial cavity partially or completely. It results from incomplete resorption of the medial walls of the fused M邦llerian ducts. The septum is typically avascular and poorly distensible, which can impair implantation and placental development in pregnancy [3,4].Clinical PerspectiveIn a septate uterus, pregnancy typically occurs in one hemicavity, as the septum restricts expansion into both sides, with implantation usually occurring on the well-vascularised lateral wall [2,3]. In rare cases, pregnancy can continue despite placental implantation on the septum, representing an unusual presentation as mentioned in some case reports, and cited in Calis et al. (2018) and in Martinez?Pe?uela et al. (2019) [1,6]. Such cases may lead to complications like foetal growth restriction or preterm birth, yet may occasionally result in successful outcomes with close monitoring [1,3,4]. Hence, in such cases, ultrasound monitoring of placental location and foetal growth is needed [5,6].Imaging PerspectiveDiagnostic pearls include a narrowed uterine contour with persistent midline echo and extension of the gestational sac across the septum. Key findings include abnormal uterine shape on 2D ultrasound, placental tissue implanted on the midline septum and foetal parts extending across the septum to occupy both uterine cavities. Final diagnosis is best confirmed with 3D ultrasound, MRI or hysteroscopy, which clearly delineate the septum, uterine morphology, and placental location [1,6].OutcomeTherapeutic options in pregnancies with a septate uterus and placental implantation on the septum are limited to close monitoring, as surgical correction (metroplasty) is contraindicated during pregnancy [1,4]. Prognosis depends on septum vascularity and placental function; risks include miscarriage, growth restriction, and preterm labour [1,4,5]. Imaging plays a crucial role in therapy planning〞3D ultrasound and MRI help assess septal extent, placental location, and foetal growth, guiding surveillance strategies and delivery planning to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes in these rare presentations [1].Take Home Message / Teaching PointsPlacental implantation on the uterine septum is a rare condition that clinicians should be aware of during antenatal care.Accurate diagnosis requires the use of advanced imaging techniques, which can help differentiate it from more common placental positions.Once diagnosed, these cases need close monitoring for potential foetal growth restriction and placental insufficiency.A carefully planned delivery strategy is essential to minimise maternal and foetal risks.",Gravid bicornuate uterus with intercornual communicationGravid didelphys uterus with partial fusionGravid septate uterus with septal placental implantationGravid arcuate uterus with exaggerated indentationGravid uterus with intrauterine synechiae or band,Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation,3,19172;18689;18477,Area of InterestObstetrics (Pregnancy / birth / postnatal period)  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasoundNo Procedure;Special FocusObstetrics;,case_number,4,Case number 19172,"{""A"": ""Gravid bicornuate uterus with intercornual communication"", ""B"": ""Gravid didelphys uterus with partial fusion"", ""C"": ""Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation"", ""D"": ""Gravid arcuate uterus with exaggerated indentation"", ""E"": ""Gravid uterus with intrauterine synechiae or band""}",C,Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation,A,C,"[""EURORAD/Case number 19172/9j-lan1J.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19172/3IkFp9cV.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19172/rGOMevT1.jpg""]","[""USG image showing a thin central uterine septum dividing the amniotic sac within two uterine hemicavities (solid arrow), with few loops of umbilical cord and part of a foetal lower limb seen within the right hemicavity (stars), placenta implanted on the left side of the septum (hexagon) and another loop of the umbilical cord within amniotic fluid within the left hemicavity (solid arrow head)."", ""USG image showing a thin central uterine septum dividing the amniotic sac within two hemicavities (solid arrow), with part of the foetal abdomen seen within the right hemicavity (star), placenta implanted on the left side of the septum (hexagon) and a few loops of the umbilical cord within amniotic fluid within the left hemicavity (solid arrowhead)."", ""USG image showing the left uterine hemicavity with anterior placenta (hexagon) and one of the foetal upper limbs (star).""]"
Case number 19090,2025/10/7,https://www.eurorad.org/case/19090,"A 74-year-old woman presented for a breast ultrasound, clinically indicated due to the presence of a solitary, mildly palpable nodular area near the scar of a previous breast resection performed several years earlier for a benign condition (intraductal papilloma). She denied any relevant associated symptoms.","Ultrasound examination revealed, in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, a superficial hypoechoic lesion measuring approximately 20 mm in diameter, with well-defined, lobulated margins (Figure 1a) and minimal internal vascularity on colour Doppler (Figure 1b), located adjacent to the previous surgical scar. No other significant or suspicious findings were noted in either breast. Bilateral axillary lymph nodes appeared mildly hyperplastic, but with preserved echo structure.In view of the imaging findings and clinical context, an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histological analysis of the breast tissue revealed extensive stromal fibrosis with a nodular infiltrate of small B and T lymphocytes and a moderate number of CD138-positive plasma cells, which showed polyclonal expression for kappa and lambda light chains. Eosinophilic granulocytes were also present. Immunohistochemistry showed over 50 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field (HPF) in multiple fields, raising suspicion for IgG4-related disease, especially when considered together with clinical and laboratory findings. No carcinoma was found, and the lesion was classified as B2 (benign).The patient underwent ultrasound (Figures 2a and 2b) and mammographic (Figures 3a and 3b) follow-up at 6 months, which confirmed the presence of the vascularised hypoechoic lesion with well-defined, lobulated margins. She was subsequently referred for a specialised rheumatologic consultation.","BackgroundIgG4-related breast disease (IgG4-BD), also known as IgG4-related sclerosing mastitis, is a rare and under-recognised form of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a multisystemic immune-mediated condition [1]. It was first characterised in 2003 [2]. Breast involvement is extremely uncommon, with only 48 cases reported in the literature to date [3].Clinical PerspectiveClinically, IgG4-BD often presents incidentally and mimics malignancy in the guise of painless, solitary masses, often discovered on routine imaging [4]. Systemic symptoms are unusual. Features like axillary lymphadenopathy or nipple retraction have been reported but are uncommon. Concomitant involvement of classically affected IgG4-RD organs (i.e., pancreas, salivary or lacrimal glands) does not occur in all cases, therefore making isolated IgG4-BD challenging to diagnose [3].Imaging PerspectiveImaging with mammography, ultrasound and MRI often show ill-defined, non-calcified lesions, with specific features which are suspicious for malignancy. PET-FDG (Positron emission tomography 每 fluorodeoxyglucose) imaging, when available, may show uptake in involved regions [3].Histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosing IgG4-BD, typically revealing dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells, and high IgG4 + IgG + cell ratios [4,5]. However, typical IgG4-RD features〞storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis〞are often absent in breast cases, suggesting a need to adapt current diagnostic criteria for this specific manifestation. Additionally, while serum IgG4 levels are often elevated, they may be normal and must be interpreted together within the overall clinical picture [3].OutcomeTreatment for IgG4-BD is not standardised, but current guidelines recommend treating both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy, showing excellent response and low relapse rates. Rituximab and other immunomodulators appear promising but are not yet widely used [6].ConclusionIn conclusion, IgG4-related breast disease (IgG4-BD) is a rare but important differential diagnosis for suspicious breast lumps that mimic malignancy but are benign on biopsy. Greater awareness among clinicians and pathologists is crucial to prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Future diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease should consider organ-specific histological differences, especially for breast, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and management.Take Home MessageIgG4-related breast disease is a rare, benign condition that can closely mimic breast malignancy on imaging. Accurate diagnosis relies on histopathological evaluation and awareness of this under-recognised entity to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention and guide appropriate therapy.All patient data have been completely anonymised throughout the entire manuscript and related files.",IgG4-related breast diseaseInvasive ductal carcinomaPapillomatosisMass-forming ductal carcinoma in situLymphoproliferative disorderGranulomatous mastitis,IgG4-related breast disease,6,19322;19305;19289;19240;19239;19223;19132;19090;19078;19050;19001;18968;18952;18946;18925;18866;18847;18823;18758;18710;18682;18601;18548;18440;18439;18430;18401,Area of InterestBreast  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasoundNo Procedure;No Special Focus;,case_number,18,Case number 19090,"{""A"": ""IgG4-related breast disease"", ""B"": ""Invasive ductal carcinoma"", ""C"": ""Papillomatosis"", ""D"": ""Mass-forming ductal carcinoma in situ"", ""E"": ""Lymphoproliferative disorder""}",A,IgG4-related breast disease,C,A,"[""EURORAD/Case number 19090/QA0JI0U4.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19090/2PVJnMNQ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19090/52JYZ7Ib.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19090/XYRJp69g.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19090/D3J-5SqL.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19090/EddGB11p.jpg""]","[""Single unilateral hypoechoic nodular lesion with polylobulated margins, measuring 20 mm, in the right breast of our patient.

Case number 19087,2025/7/7,https://www.eurorad.org/case/19134,"An 8-year-old male patient presented with chronic left lumbar discomfort, claudication, anaemia (Hb = 8 g/dL), and hyperleukocytosis (12000/mm3). He has been receiving therapy for anaemia for two years.","Ultrasound (US) shows multiple thick-walled collections with echogenic fluid content occupying the left renal fossa and loss of renal parenchyma＊s architecture with no corticomedullary differentiation. The thin remaining peripheric parenchymal bundle shows no limits with the thick-walled collections. There is a central pyelic stone measuring 20 mm with a posterior acoustic shadow and a hyperechoic aspect of the perirenal fat.CT (computed tomography) shows left renal enlargement with destruction of parenchymal architecture and dilated calyces consistent with the ※bear paw sign§ (Figure 1a), coexisting blurring of perirenal fat, psoas muscle enlargement and abscess formation (Figure 1b), as well as nephroureterolithiasis (Figures 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d).

Reduced cortical uptake, particularly in the left upper pole, was seen both at DMSA and DTPA scans.","BackgroundXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XPN) is a rare form of renal and perirenal destructive infection that is generally considered an adult condition [1] and is uncommon in children. Several hypotheses have been put forward to understand the physiopathology of XPN, including urinary tract obstruction due to lithiasis or malformation, and a neglected or ineffectively treated urinary tract infection. Symptoms are mild, which explains the delay in diagnosis. Our case presents an 8-year-old male patient with a delayed diagnosis of XPN, whose only symptoms included chronic lumbar pain and anaemia.Clinical PerspectiveClinical presentation varies depending on the form of the disease: lower back pain, recurrent fever, altered general condition with malaise, and sometimes urinary symptoms. Clinical examination reveals a lumbar mass in 50% of cases [2]. Exceptionally, it may present with fistulisation toward the subcutaneous tissue [2]. The biological disturbances observed during XPN include hyperleukocytosis, leukocyturia, pyuria, inflammatory anaemia or erythropoietin deficiency [3].Imaging PerspectiveCT and MRI are more sensitive than US for the diagnosis of XPN. MRI is a great alternative to CT scan, especially in children, due to the lack of radiation exposure. The pathognomonic sign of ※bear paw§, added to the identification of obstructive Staghorn calculus, on CT images, are very suggestive of the diagnosis [5]. CT images allow for evaluation of the stage of the disease based on local extension, accordingly [3]:Stage I每 focal intrarenal involvement.Stage II每 extension beyond the kidney, respecting Gerota＊s fascia.Stage III每 extra renal extension to neighbouring tissues.OutcomeThe treatment of XPN is both medical and surgical. In the diffuse form with total and irreversible renal destruction, nephrectomy is performed [4]. In the focal form, percutaneous drainage of the abscess and adjunctive antibiotic therapy prior to partial nephrectomy can be discussed [6]. In our case, broad-spectrum antibiotherapy was administered both before and following left nephrectomy. The patient received blood transfusion post-operatively.The nephrectomy specimen was macroscopically friable and fragmented, with multiple pockets of pus and staghorn lithiasis within the renal pelvis (Figure 3). The histopathology study revealed chronic inflammatory lesions and enlarged lipid-laden vacuolated macrophages, confirming the diagnosis of XPN.The prognosis after total nephrectomy is excellent. Two weeks after surgery, the child came back with marked improvement in his general state.Take Home Message / Teaching PointsXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XPN) is rarely seen in children.Mild, non-specific symptoms may cause a delay in diagnosis.CT images are very suggestive of the diagnosis, which is confirmed only with histological studies.Treatment is surgical.Excellent prognosis if XPN is early diagnosed and adequately treated.",Renal fossa tumourXanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (diffuse form)PyonephrosisHydronephrosisUrogenital tuberculosis,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (diffuse form),8,19087,"Area of InterestKidney,  Paediatric,  Urinary Tract / Bladder  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  Nuclear medicine conventional,  UltrasoundProcedureSurgery;Special FocusInfection,  Inflammation,  Pathology;",case_number,19,Case number 19087,"{""A"": ""Renal fossa tumour"", ""B"": ""Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (diffuse form)"", ""C"": ""Pyo nephrosis"", ""D"": ""Hydronephrosis"", ""E"": ""Urogenital tuberculosis""}",B,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (diffuse form),,B,"[""EURORAD/Case number 19087/UsOBnHVy.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/9-dmjDHd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/-hZ4Jgl8.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/xetF5Tya.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/YzCzNiKj.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/sD_gV9I-.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/JrM4Zha9.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19087/Df-duzup.jpg""]","[""Axial view of the enhanced CT scan through the kidneys shows the ※bear paw sign§ as a radial arrangement of low attenuation rounded spaces, consistent with dilated calyces, surrounded by enhancing thin renal parenchyma, and mimicking the appearance of a polar bear paw."", ""Coronal reconstruction illustrates an extra renal extension of the infection to the psoas muscle with enlargement and abscess formation (yellow arrow)."", ""Sagittal reconstruction shows upper caliceal lithiasis (red arrow)."", ""VR reconstruction of the nephrogenic phase."", ""Maximum intensity projection (MIP) 3D reconstruction of the late excretory phase shows a non-functional left kidney."", ""VR reconstruction of the late excretory phase shows a non-functional left kidney."", ""Renal scintigraphy results show alteration of the left kidney function."", ""Nephrectomy specimen.""]"
Case number 19078,2025/3/7,https://www.eurorad.org/case/19078,"A 49-year-old premenopausal woman presented to the gynaecologist with complaints of a painful right breast lump, which had started two weeks before. She had no known history of significant medical conditions. The physician ordered a bilateral mammography (Figure 1) and a breast ultrasound (Figure 2).","A mediolateral oblique tomosynthesis view of the right breast revealed a 7 cm asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) (Figure 1). Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic palpable mass (Figure 2) with indistinct margins and no vascularity. No suspicious axillary lymph nodes were shown. The breast lesion was assigned a BI-RADS 4C category, and a US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (10G) was performed. The diagnostic workup was completed with contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) after the biopsy (Figures 3a and 3b), which demonstrated a 7 cm non-mass enhancement in the UOQ of the right breast.Histopathological examination revealed no evidence of malignancy. The tissue showed features consistent with sclerosing lymphocytic mastitis, including a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, collagenised stroma, and a thickened basal membrane.The findings were reviewed in a multidisciplinary team with pathologists, gynaecologists and radiologists. Although the initial imaging findings were highly suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 4C), retrospective analysis revealed that the clinical and imaging features were concordant with the pathological diagnosis. Upon further review of the patient＊s history, there was no evidence of diabetes or autoimmune disease. However, laboratory tests showed chronic hyperglycaemia, with HbA1c values between 5.8% and 6.1%. She was referred to an endocrinologist and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which revealed glucose levels of 89 mg/dl at 0 minutes and 183 mg/dl at 120 minutes. Her BMI was 30.85 kg/m2.Based on these findings, a conservative approach was adopted, with dietary intervention aimed at glycaemic control. At the six-month clinical follow-up, she reported no pain or palpable lump in the breast. OGTT values had improved to 83 mg/dl at 0 minutes and 137 mg/dl at 120 minutes, with an HbA1c of 5.4%. Follow-up breast imaging one year after biopsy showed complete resolution of the focal asymmetry (Figure 4).","BackgroundLymphocytic mastitis is an uncommon fibroinflammatory breast lesion with an unclear aetiology [1每3]. It is more frequently observed in patients with poorly controlled long-standing type 1 diabetes (also known as diabetic mastopathy) [1每4]. Exogenous insulin administration may trigger inflammatory reactions in the breast [1,3]. Alternatively, the secondary autoimmune effects of the accumulation of glucose in the extracellular connective tissue are thought to induce an immune response [4] that could be a possible mechanism to explain the association of lymphocytic mastitis with type 2 diabetes, as reported herein. However, this illness has also been described in association with other autoimmune or endocrine disorders, and in patients without any such comorbidities [2每4].Clinical PerspectiveThis condition more commonly affects premenopausal women between 30 and 50 years of age [1,3,4], and is rarely observed in men with gynecomastia [1,3]. Clinically, it presents as one or more asymptomatic, firm breast masses, varying in size and location [1每4]. A predilection for the subareolar region has been reported [3,4]. Inflammatory signs at breast physical examination are usually absent [3,4].Imaging PerspectiveThe most common mammographic finding of lymphocytic mastitis is asymmetry underlying a palpable mass, generally between 3 and 6 cm in diameter [1,3,6]. Lymphocytic mastitis at mammography may disclose no findings, being distinctive for the absence of masses, calcifications and spiculated lesions [1,3,5,6].Ultrasound often shows hypoechoic areas with irregular margins and marked posterior acoustic shadowing, caused by fibrosis. This prominent shadowing is characteristic and often more pronounced than that seen in neoplastic lesions. Although it is more commonly associated with malignancy, it can also be observed in benign lesions with a high degree of fibrosis [1,3,6].Although MRI findings are not specific for lymphocytic mastitis, they may aid in establishing the diagnosis and confirming the benign nature of the lesion [5]. At MRI, lymphocytic mastitis most often demonstrates gradual and persistent non-mass enhancement, but it has no specific MRI pattern, and it may disclose no findings [3每6]. To our knowledge, contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) findings of lymphocytic mastitis have not been previously reported. We present the first documented case showing this entity as a non-mass enhancement on CEM. Our findings correlate well with previously reported MRI-based studies [5,6].OutcomeCore needle biopsy is the preferred diagnostic method [1每4]. Clinical and imaging findings of lymphocytic mastitis are nonspecific, often overlapping breast cancer features. Therefore, this diagnosis requires histological proof with core needle biopsy, multidisciplinary correlation, and clinical and imaging follow-up. Excisional biopsy should be reserved for cases with reasonable doubt and suspicion of malignancy, especially considering the high recurrence rates reported after surgical excision [1,3].A conservative, observational approach is initially recommended to avoid unnecessary surgery [1,3]. Follow-up should include annual clinical review and imaging with mammography and/or ultrasound [1]. Marking the biopsy site with a clip can help to confirm adequate biopsy sampling and facilitate future monitoring. Following an excision, recurrence rates can be as high as 32% [3]. There is no evidence to suggest that lymphocytic mastitis increases the risk of the development of breast cancer [3].Take Home Message / Teaching PointsDiagnosing lymphocytic mastopathy can be challenging due to its similarities with breast carcinoma [1,3]. The diagnosis is particularly difficult in patients without type 1 diabetes or autoimmune diseases. Multidisciplinary integration of clinical and multimodal imaging findings is of paramount importance to avoid repeated biopsies and unnecessary excisional procedures.Follow-up with imaging〞including mammography and ultrasound, CEM, or MRI〞is important, as lymphocytic mastitis may be a self-limited disease, as demonstrated in our report. However, recurrence in the same or the contralateral breast is possible, highlighting the need for continued surveillance.",Breast carcinomaGranulomatous mastitisNon-Hodgkin lymphomaPlasma cell mastitisLymphocytic mastopathyTraumatic lesionsPanarteritis nodosa,Lymphocytic mastopathy,5,19078,"Area of InterestBreast  ;Imaging TechniqueMammography,  UltrasoundProcedureComparative studies,  Diagnostic procedure,  Vacuum assisted biopsy;Special FocusMetabolic disorders,  Outcomes;",case_number,20,Case number 19078,"{""A"": ""Breast carcinoma"", ""B"": ""Granulomatous mastitis"", ""C"": ""Lymphocytic mastopathy"", ""D"": ""Traumatic lesions"", ""E"": ""Panarteritis nodosa""}",C,Lymphocytic mastopathy,B,C,"[""EURORAD/Case number 19078/axohBigX.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19078/wW-BzTLK.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19078/jip-q3Ln.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19078/Q8FpnhKf.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Case number 19078/NLhoD9zB.jpg""]","[""Right mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views with an asymmetry (arrows) on the upper outer quadrant, palpable, with a cutaneous marker on it."", ""Upper outer quadrant of right breast showing a marked hypoechoic area underlying a palpable mass."", ""Mediolateral oblique (3a) and craniocaudal (3b) views.

Endoscopic third ventriculostomy relieved the pressure symptoms of hydrocephalus and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Further neurosurgery was not possible and the patient underwent radical radiotherapy with good response.,"The differential diagnosis of masses in the region of pineal gland includes (their distinguishing radiological features are given in brackets) [1];?	Pineal cyst (well circumscribed fluid density lesions)?	Primary Pineal tumours (radiological features vary depending upon grade of the lesion.

Vascular lesions (radiographically distinct lesions with no soft tissue mass effect with possible associated dilated vessels or vascular aneurysms)","A 43-year-old previously fit and healthy gentleman presented with progressively worsening symptoms of early morning headaches, nausea, dizziness and vision blurring. CT examination showed space occupied lesion. MRI revealed enhancing pineal mass with signs of hydrocephalus. He underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy, and a biopsy was taken. Symptoms of hydrocephalus resolved and the pathology confirmed WHO grade IV Pineoblastoma (Ki67 >40%).Futher surgical resection was not feasible due to operative risks. MRI of the spine did not show any abnormality and lumber puncture revealed highly suspicious for malignant cells 每 Chang stage M3. Serum tumour markers, AFP and HCG levels were normal. A diagnosis of high grade pineoblastoma was made and the patient was offered craniospinal irradiation. He received 40.8 Gray in 24 fractions to cranio-spinal axis and 15.3 Gray in 9 fractions as a boost to the pineal tumour. He developed alopecia and grade 1 scalp erythema. Soon after completion of his tumour, he was admitted with sepsis secondary to bilateral pneumonias which was treated accordingly. He made a full recovery. Post treatment, he was also found to have low cortisol and increased ACTH levels. Endocrinology opinion was obtained and it was felt that the picture was consistent with partial hypoadrenalism likely secondary to exogenous use of steroids. There was no significant evidence of hypopituitrism. He was commenced on steroid replacement and recovered very well. Repeat MRI three months after completion of radiotherapy showed good response to the treatment.Pineal region tumours are rare, <1% of all intracranial tumours (in children, 3-8%) [2]. Germ cell tumours are more common in this region. Pineocytomas are more common than Pineoblastoma, which are extremely rare. Maximum possible surgery is treatment of choice. Radiotherpay is used adjuvantly and radically in case of residual disease post surgery [3]. In case of metastasis (like in this case as CSF was positive for malignant cells), craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is treatment of choice. It is associated with side effects e.g. tiredness, emesis, skin reaction, alopecia, bone marrow suppression, headaches, sleep and memory disturbance. It can also affect the pituitary function due to some unavoidable dose to the pituitary gland. The patient needs to be under regular follow up with surveillance images. The prognosis depends on histological type, size of the tumour and extent of disease at presentation [4].

Case number 10142,2012/6/21,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10142,"A 66-year-old male patient was hospitalized to undergo elective colonic recanalization surgery. One year earlier, he had urgent resection of sigmoid and descending colon for diverticulitis with temporary colostomy, complicated by abdominal wall abscess.Preoperative diagnostic workup diagnosed good performance status and normal biochemistry (including renal function).","Preoperatively, contrast-enhanced CT (Fig. 1) visualized normal appearance of left-sided colostomy excluding residual abscess collections in both abdomen and anterior abdominal wall. Double-contrast barium enema, performed through both rectum and colostomy, did not detect abnormal findings (Fig. 2). Left ureteral J-stent was positioned to minimize risk of intraoperative injury.48 hours after elective surgical colonic recanalization, persistent abdominal pain and fever led to urgent request of CT (Fig. 3). With surgical drainage in place, a moderate-sized fluid-attenuation collection was detected in the peritoneal cul-de-sac.After intravenous contrast administration, excretory phase acquisition completed with three-dimensional volume-rendering reformations detected opacification of the above-mentioned pelvic fluid collection from leaking distal right ureter, allowing diagnosis of iatrogenic urinoma.Surgical correction including ureteral reimplantation was necessary.","Although uncommon, iatrogenic urinary tract injuries (UTI) are well-known, potentially dangerous postoperative complications that may represent a source of concern due to the associated severe morbidity and occasional mortality. Increasingly diagnosed because of the large number and complexity of procedures, UTI may occur during gynaecological (two-thirds of cases), general surgical or urological procedures. Due to subtle and unspecific symptoms and signs, diagnosis is delayed in up to 80% of cases, with a median time to diagnosis of 6 days [1, 2].Urinomas are defined as abnormal collections of extravasated urine resulting from disruption of the collecting system at any level, and most usually originate from the kidney. Alternatively, an urinoma may result from ureteral injury during gynaecologic, retroperitoneal pelvic or general surgeries such as colectomy for cancer, diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel diseases. Risk is further increased by prior abdominal surgeries and laparoscopy (compared to open laparotomy) [3, 4]. Prophylactic preoperative ureteral stent placement and surgical experience may be insufficient to prevent UTI occurrence and intraoperative identification [3, 5].The lower ureter is most often (80-90% of cases) involved with lumen discontinuity, urine extravasation or both. Although minimally invasive endourological treatment with ureteral stenting is increasingly performed, treatment usually requires uretero-neocystostomy in the distal ureter, end-to-end anastomosis in the proximal and mid-ureter [2, 7]Often clinically unsuspected, at multidetector CT (MDCT) urinomas usually appear as confined fluid-attenuation (0-20 Hounsfield Units, HU) collections on unenhanced scans, with opacification (up to 200 HU) corresponding to urine leak on excretory phase (5-20 minutes after injection). Opacification is inhomogeneous, denser close to the leaking source in larger lesions, and usually progresses over repeated delayed-phase acquisitions. Urinomas may have variable shapes, collect at different sites close to the laceration, or dissect into retroperitoneal compartments, resulting in diagnostic uncertainty and possible misinterpretation as ascites, abdomino-pelvic abscesses or hematomas, or cystic masses. Furthermore, multiplanar reformations and 3D volume imaging from MDCT-urography help in depiction of the UTI extent and ureteral stump [4, 6].In conclusion, the diagnosis of urinoma from UTI should not be delayed or missed because of the associated significant morbidity. High clinical suspicion, awareness of its characteristic CT features and prompt appropriate imaging including multidetector CT-urography are crucial to avoid further complications such as abscess formation or hydronephrosis [1, 2].",Iatrogenic intraoperative ureteral injury with urinoma.Postoperative fluid collection / seromaAbscessLoculated ascitesExtraluminal enteric material,Iatrogenic intraoperative ureteral injury with urinoma.,8,10784;10142,"Area of InterestColon,  Urinary Tract / Bladder  ;Imaging TechniqueFluoroscopy,  CTProcedureBarium enema,  Complications;Special FocusAcute,  Infection;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,85,Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role,"{""A"": ""Extraluminal enteric material"", ""B"": ""Abscess"", ""C"": ""Iatrogenic intraoperative ureteral injury with urinoma."", ""D"": ""Loculated ascites"", ""E"": ""Postoperative fluid collection / seroma""}",C,Iatrogenic intraoperative ureteral injury with urinoma.,A,C,"[""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/rFJHERnl.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/nXHN5qJ4.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/PpDOAD8S.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/RHlQ2weH.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/E21Vc8nY.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/HfUMmxEE.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/DvKXITPc.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Intraoperative ureteral injury with iatrogenic urinoma: multidetector CT-urography findings and role/UGyHgAzj.jpg""]","[""Prior to elective recanalization surgery, normal appearance of left-sided colostomy is observed, with exclusion of residual abscess collections in both abdomen and anterior abdominal wall."", ""Prior to elective recanalization surgery, double-contrast enema through left-sided colostomy (a) does not reveal significant abnormalities of the upstream descending and transverse colon, whereas the rectal stump is collapsed (b)."", ""Prior to elective recanalization surgery, double-contrast enema through left-sided colostomy (a) does not reveal significant abnormalities of the upstream descending and transverse colon, whereas the rectal stump is collapsed (b)."", ""On unenhanced scans the peritoneal cul-de-sac is occupied by a moderate-sized fluid-attenuation collection (*).

Case number 10146,2012/10/8,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10146,62-year-old male patient presented with soft tissue swelling at the volar side of the wrist. There was no history of trauma and no reference of neurological signs. History of colon cancer was present.,"A 62-year-old male patient, with a slow-growing mass of the right wrist, was referred to the radiology department for evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in the axial and sagittal planes. An oval-shaped mass of 48 x 12 x 10 mm was depicted in the carpal tunnel. The tumor showed low to intermediate signal on T1 weighted images(Fig.1a) and inhomogeneous predominantly low signal on T2 (Fig.1b). After intravenous contrast administration (Fig.1c), the tumor showed inhomogeneous enhancement (Fig.2). Peripheral enhancement extends around an ulnar sided flexor tendon. The tumor was surgically excised and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.","Tendon sheath fibroma (TSF) is a rare dense, slow growing benign soft tissue tumor attached to a tendon sheath. It presents as a small subcutaneous nodule that slowly increases in size. Tendon sheath fibromas often occur in the fingers, hands and toes. The onset is usually marked by noticing a small mass or swelling [1, 2]. It is difficult to diagnose TSF by clinical examination, since ganglion cyst or giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCTTS) are much more common [3].Radiographs are usually normal. Ultrasound can depict the correlation of the mass with the surrounding structures with dynamic imaging. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation. A TSF appears as a well defined nodular mass abutting the tendon sheath. On T1-weighted images it shows signal intensity equal to or lower than that of skeletal muscle. On T2-weighted images, heterogeneous predominantly low signal intensity is seen, correlating to dense collagenous tissue. However, more cellular areas can be seen in the early stages of tumor development, exhibiting mild to intense enhancement after Gd administration [1, 3, 4, 5]. In our case fluid is seen in the carpal tunnel as well, probably secondary to surmenage.Differential diagnosis includes a GCTTS, which is more common. The hemosiderin deposition, seen as susceptibility artifacts on gradient echo sequences, is diagnostic. A GCTTS occurs more frequently in the lower extremities than TSF, while TSF usually occurs in the younger adult population and especially men [2, 3]. Radiologically, bone erosion is not a common finding in TSF compared to GCTTS. More cellular forms of TSF show enhancement and in case of a peripheral zone of enhancement, nodular fasciitis has to be considered. However, characteristic for nodular fasciitis is its rapid growth in weeks. Nodular fasciitis can be suggested when the mass extends along the fascia and is not associated with tendon sheath [4]. In addition, in cellular forms of TSF, fibrous histiocytoma and fibrosarcoma have to be considered as well. However, a fibrous histiocytoma can be found in skin and muscle, preferably in the lower limb and head and neck region [5]. Finally in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of reumatoid nodules can be appreciated fixed to the tendons. The final diagnosis is made microscopically based on the different histologic features. Treatment is by local surgical excision with preservation of the tendon, with a reported recurrence of 24% [2]",Fibroma of the tendon sheath.Giant-cell tumor of tendon sheathGanglion cystNodular fasciitisFibrous histiocytomaRheumatoid nodule,Fibroma of the tendon sheath.,6,18111;17790;17016;16260;16224;16072;15907;15826;15595;15509;15586;15458;14993;14716;14222;14060;13960;13580;12495;12132;11508;11555;11509;10854;10259;10146;10100;9578,Area of InterestMusculoskeletal soft tissue  ;Imaging TechniqueMRProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,86,Fibroma of the tendon sheath,"{""A"": ""Fibroma of the tendon sheath."", ""B"": ""Ganglion cyst"", ""C"": ""Giant-cell tumor of tendon sheath"", ""D"": ""Fibrous histiocytoma"", ""E"": ""Nodular fasciitis""}",A,Fibroma of the tendon sheath.,C,A,"[""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/mh-qhmui.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/QUcmV0NI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/cih5ximd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/NDNcv67C.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/bfmSA3Zk.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/dbF_hfUz.jpg""]","[""Axial T1WTSE image of the wrist shows a lobulated mass in the carpal tunnel.

Case number 10186,2012/6/6,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10186,A 38-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with left quadrants abdominal pain. Past medical history was unremarkable.Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness. Laboratory tests were abnormal with leukocytosis and the patient was febrile.Abdominal ultrasound and CT were performed.,"Transverse and longitudinal sonograms of the left flank show a hypoechoic lesion with no vascularization and adjacent hyperechoic fat. The lesion presents a small anechoic (liquid) component.Enhanced axial CT examination demonstrates a well-defined hypodense mesenteric cystic mass, with fluid-fluid level due to different liquid contents (ranging from the attenuation of water to that of fat). There is adjacent fat stranding and peripheral enhancement.Complete surgical excision was performed.","When the radiologist sees a cystic abdominal mass the first step is to determine the organ of origin. If it does not arise from a solid abdominopelvic organ but from the mesentery or omentum the differential diagnosis includes lymphangioma, enteric duplication cyst, enteric cyst, mesothelial cyst and nonpancreatic pseudocyst [1].Mesenteric and omental cystic masses are uncommon lesions [1, 2]. The most common type of mesenteric or omental cyst is lymphangioma. Mesenteric cysts are located between the leaves of the mesentery, mostly of the small bowel. Omental cysts are located in the greater omentum or lesser sac [3].All types of mesenteric/omental cysts occur in children and young adults and usually do not occur in the elderly. They usually manifest as a large, painful abdominal mass [2].Lymphangioma is a congenital malformation that occasionally occurs in the mesentery [1] and is more commonly located in the mesentery than in the omentum [2]. They are large thin walled cystic masses that are usually multiloculated. The fluid contents are predominantly chylous but may be serous and fluid-fluid levels can be seen [1]. In some cases, lymphangioma is complicated by haemorrhage or infection [1, 2, 3].Enteric duplication cysts are usually attached to a normal bowel but occasionally migrate into the mesentery, thus becoming a type of mesenteric cyst [1].They are unilocular cysts with predominantly serous content and have a thick-wall, that enhances after contrast material is injected.Enteric cysts are usually unilocular, thin smooth-walled cysts, because there is no reduplication of the bowel wall, as in enteric duplication cysts, with serous content. Mesothelial cysts are thin-walled, unilocular and contain serous material.Non-pancreatic pseudocysts are thought to be sequelae of a mesenteric or omental abscess or hematoma and are thick-walled, with haemorrhagic or purulent contents [1, 2, 3].Other cystic lesions that can be located in the mesentery or omentum include cystic neoplasms [1].Because of the overlapping imaging features of mesenteric and omental cysts and other cystic masses, the diagnosis remains histopathologic [1]. Imaging is useful to delineate the extent of the mass. In the presented case, the fluid-fluid level and the fat content is suggestive of lymphangioma. As there is associated enhancing thickened wall and stranding of adjacent mesenteric fat on CT and the patient is febrile and there is leucocytosis, lymphangioma complicated by infection must be considered.Histopathology of the cyst was consistent with the diagnosis of a lymphangioma with inflammatory changes.",Lymphangioma with inflammatory changesEnteric duplication cystMesothelial cystEnteric cystNon-pancreatic pseudocyst,Lymphangioma with inflammatory changes,2,17470;16887;16465;15676;15673;15584;14439;14017;14154;13552;13448;12978;12672;12637;12454;12296;12102;11978;12031;11812;11700;11668;11597;11530;10714;11196;11097;11191;11155;11061;10742;10405;10643;10308;10479;9892;10497;10375;10404;10266;10250;10186;9913;9976;9844;9555;9509,"Area of InterestAbdomen  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasound,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusCongenital,  Cysts;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,88,Complicated Mesenteric Cyst,"{""A"": ""Lymphangioma with inflammatory changes"", ""B"": ""Enteric duplication cyst"", ""C"": ""Non-pancreatic pseudocyst"", ""D"": ""Mesothelial cyst"", ""E"": ""Enteric cyst""}",A,Lymphangioma with inflammatory changes,B,A,"[""EURORAD/Complicated Mesenteric Cyst/CxouBNJn.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Complicated Mesenteric Cyst/bt-aW5Ew.jpg""]","[""Transverse and longitudinal sonograms of the left flank show a hypoechoic lesion with no vascularization and adjacent hyperechoic fat.

Angio chest CT pointed out lower left lung bronchiectasis (Fig.2), no signs of pulmonary-thromboembolism, and a 3. 5 cm sized saccular aneurysm resulting from penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer in the mid third of the descending aorta (Fig.3, 4).24 hours later, while treated conservatively with large spectrum antibiotics, his condition worsened with tachycardia and hypotension.Endoscopy mentioned no significant hemorrhagic findings.Unenhanced CT revealed a bulge in the left antero-medial aspect of the descending thoracic aorta, effacement of the periaortic fat plane along with gas bubbles surrounding the aortic wall(Fig.5). Enhanced sequences showed these abnormalities related to an enlarged (4.2 cm sized) saccular aneurysm with hazy aortic wall, intramural air (Figs.6, 7) and revealed a small amount of contrast extravasation in the gastric fundus(Fig.8).The patient was submitted to an emergency surgical intervention with poor outcome, confirming the presence of an aortoesophageal fistula.","The aortoenteric fistula, a rare but potentially fatal entity, is a significant challenge to radiologists when it come to diagnosis , specially because of its subtle and nonspecific imaging findings. An early diagnosis is fundamental for patient survival.The cardinal clinical signs include hematemesis, melena, sepsis, and abdominal pain, but the condition may also be clinically occult. [1, 2]Considering clinical signs may not be present or may not be sufficiently specific, imaging is most often necessary to achieve an accurate diagnosis.CT has a variable specificity (33%每100%) and sensitivity (40%每90%) for the diagnosis of aortoenteric fistulas.[3, 4] For an effective use of this modality in the initial diagnostic examination, radiologists must be familiar with the spectrum of CT appearances.Aortoesophageal fistulas are divided into primary and secondary forms, depending on the presence or absence of prior aortic reconstructive surgery. [5]Primary aortoenteric fistulas occur in a native aorta without a history of prior intervention and are much more rare than secondary fistula. Causes include atherosclerotic penetrating ulcer (most common) , foreign bodies, aortitis, esophageal malignancies. [6, 7]Secondary aortoenteric fistulas occur in the setting of prior surgery or intervention, in patients with prior aortic surgery or graft placement. [8]Primary CT findings involves ectopic gas either within or directly adjacent to the aortic lumen. [1] Rarely, gas can be traced from the esophagus to the aorta. [3]Direct extravasation of contrast from the aorta into the esophagus and leakage of enteric contrast directly into the periaortic space are extraordinarily rare.[2, 3]Secondary CT findings encompasses effacement of the periaortic fat plane, focal thickening and tethering of a esophageal wall immediately adjacent to the aorta, periaortic free fluid and soft tissue thickening, penetrating ulcer or intramural hematoma immediately adjacent to a tethered, abnormal appearing esophagus.[9]Mimics of aortoenteric fistulas are severe perigraft infection, aortitis, mycotic aneurysms, perianeurysmal fibrosis and immediate post-operative aorta [2, 3, 4]Differentiation is aided by the observation of ectopic gas, loss of the normal fat plane, extravasation of aortic contrast material into the enteric lumen, or leakage of enteric contrast material into the paraprosthetic space; these features are highly suggestive of aortoenteric fistula in a patient with bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract [1,7,10].Classical treatment involves surgical ressection of the infected graft, esophageal ressection, creation of an extra-anatomic vascular bypass graft. Mortality rates are up to 90%. Modern treatment trend implies endovascular techniques, lower risk of perioperative complications, avoids most catastrophic complications after surgery [11].",Aortoesophageal fistulaPenetrating atherosclerotic ulcerInfectious aortiitisMycotic aneurysmPerigraft infection,Aortoesophageal fistula,8,17906;16337;15543;14653;13432;12604;11994;11745;11935;10280;11413;11073;10504;10489;10388;10361;10208;9799;9603,"Area of InterestVascular,  Arteries / Aorta,  Lung  ;Imaging TechniqueConventional radiography,  CT-Angiography,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusAneurysms;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,98,Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm,"{""A"": ""Mycotic aneurysm"", ""B"": ""Perigraft infection"", ""C"": ""Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer"", ""D"": ""Infectious aortiitis"", ""E"": ""Aortoesophageal fistula""}",E,Aortoesophageal fistula,C,E,"[""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/Cuif0Mvd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/ktrFMg-s.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/w1l3KhZd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/rrQtO6ts.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/gmPYSflA.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/zHDGjeFd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/UR8KELHa.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/DRPLWaip.jpg""]","[""Chest X-ray revealed a  hazy opacity and slight  increase in bronchovascular markings in the lower left hemithorax.

Case number 10653,2013/1/25,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10653,A 13-year-old female patient presented to her general practitioner with diffuse abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound was performed showing a large mass in the right adnexal area. She was otherwise healthy and all laboratory tests were within normal values but delta-4-androstenedione which was 6.73ng/dl (normal values: 0.46-3.39 ng/dl).,"Abdominal ultrasound reported a solid inhomogeneous mass occupying the right adnexal area. Transvaginal ultrasound was not indicated since the patient had no prior sexual relations.MRI was performed with the following sequences: axial T1 and T2-weighted images, sagittal and coronal T2-weighted images. Contrast-enhanced sequences were not obtained and antispasmodics were not administrated. The tumour originated in the right ovary as demonstrated by the beak sign measuring 7x6, 5x7cm with well-defined contours. The examination showed hypointense and isointense areas on the T1-weighted images. The T2-weighted sequences demonstrated intermediate-to-high signal intensity and a 14mm-cyst in the periphery. A small amount of ascites was noticed in the right ovarian fossa. The left ovary and the uterus were unremarkable. There were no pathologic lymph nodes.After surgical resection pathology confirmed the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumor (SLCT) with retiform areas.The patient was treated with chemotherapy (bleomycin, ethoposide and cisplatinum) and maintains SLCT 4-year-remission.","Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours are rare (0.5%-1% of all ovarian tumours) and usually occur unilaterally in females under 30 years (mean 25 years) [1-3]. They are derived from the sex cord-stromal structures of the ovary, four subtypes are defined: well-differentiated, intermediately-differentiated, poorly-differentiated and retiform. These tumours can cause hyperandrogenism resulting in virilisation in one-third to one-half of the patients [1, 4]. In our case the patient presented mildly elevated levels of testosterone derivates without virilisation and abdominal pain. Regardless the initial size the majority of these are localised tumours (stage I) with favourable outcome [1, 3, 4].On CT and MRI, SLCT are well-defined, enhancing solid masses with variable-sized intratumoural cysts. Calcifications are rare and enhancement varies according to the solid component. T1W images are usually isointense and T2W images are partially isointense or slightly hyperintense on the solid component and hyperintense in the cystic content [1, 3, 5]. On transvaginal ultrasound they appear as large isoechoic/hypoechoic tumours with cystic component often due to internal haemorrhage or necrosis [2]. Our MRI depicted a large mass with a peripheral small cyst, with high intensity signal on T2W and low intensity on T1W.In the differential diagnosis several tumour types arising in young patients and sharing a similar morphology should be considered.Granulosa cell tumour is the most common sex cord每stromal tumour representing 70% of all sex cord每stromal tumours. Adult-type is more frequent affecting postmenopausal women. Presenting similar radiological features, the juvenile type may resemble to SLCT, often as large multiloculated tumour. The symptoms are related to elevated level of oestrogens [1-2] and can present as isosexual pseudoprecocity. Our patient did not present these symptoms and MRI showed large tumour with small cyst rather than a large-cystic-tumour.Fibromas and thecomas are solid masses with low signal intensity on T2-weighted images because they have abundant collagen. These tumours often have variable extent of calcification or degeneration. Fibromas lack hormonal activity whilst thecoma may show oestrogenic activity. In our case T2W sequences demonstrated intermediate-to-high signal intensity without calcification as opposed to the fibromas and thecomas that are markedly hypointense on T2W.Sclerosing stromal cell tumour (SSCT) also a very rare tumour is usually a large mass with cystic and solid components usually without hormonal activity. On CT and MRI they show typical early peripheral enhancement with centripetal progression [2].

Rectal digital examination detected a solid lesion in the left side of the rectal wall.","The colonoscopy identified a polypoid lesion, located up to 4 cm from pectinea line, 3.5 cm in size, solid and easily bleeding. The biopsy was positive for extranodal marginal zone b-cell lymphoma of MALT type (CD20+, CD79a+, CD10+, CD5-). MRI showed a lesion 4 x 2.5 cm in size, located in the left side of the rectal wall, with regular margins, minimum infiltration of the mesorectum and homogeneous signal intensity: isointense on T1W, slightly hyperintense on T2W compared with adjacent muscle (Fig. 1). It showed contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1W (Fig. 2). On DWI (b value 800) it was hyperintense and hypointense on ADC Map (Fig. 3). One oval mesorectal lymph nodes, 10x6 mm in size, was identified. Total body CT examination did not show other sites of pathology. The bone-marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Tumour stage, according to Ann Arbor system modified by Musshoff: I","Primary rectal lymphoma is a rare disorder: 0.1-1% of all primary rectal tumours [1]. It is prevalent in male patients between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Possible risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease, immune-suppression and pelvic irradiation. Clinical presentation in the majority of cases is nonspecific and it can be comparable with rectal carcinoma, including; anorexia, weight loss, rectal bleeding, tenesmus and palpable mass [2].Rectal lymphomas are predominantly of the non-Hodgkin type that are classified by WHO into some different subtypes: diffuse large b-cell (60%), extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT]) (15%), Burkitt (15%), peripheral T cell, mantle cell and follicular cell. There are two types of MALT-lymphoma: the first one is chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disorder related, the second type originates from lymph nodal tissue such as Peyer patches like the case we report. Hodgkin disease is less than 5% of cases. The Ann Arbor system modified by Musshoff is the most common modality for staging gastrointestinal non Hodgkin lymphoma: stage I (single lymphatic organ involved), stage II (two or more lymphatic region on the same site of the diaphragm), stage III (both sides of diaphragm), stage IV (Disseminated disease) [3].The biopsy of the lesion is essential for the diagnosis [4].Imaging and endoscopy aspects of a rectal lymphoma can be really various and sometimes it is indistinguishable from adenocarcinoma. However, a lesion that is homogeneous, fairly well demarcated, without invasion of the adjacent structure, that shows a growing pattern prevalently longitudinal and circumferential, without desmoplastic reaction and that is rarely a cause of obstruction, is suggestive of lymphoma [5, 6].MRI is fundamental for local staging while total body CT or PET/CT are essential for systemic staging; the bone-marrow biopsy is necessary to exclude a secondary lymphoma.Actually there is no consensus about the treatment of choice and the follow-up of a rectal lymphoma [7]. The case we report presented a complete response at radiation therapy documented by PET/CT performed 6 months after the end of therapy.

No high-flow vascular channels were noted. The mass showed diffuse contrast-enhancement. The lesion was adjacent to the posterior tibial cortex but not to the osteochondroma. There were no signs of medullary invasion. The posterior tibial nerve could be seen apparently entering the mass.

Clinical presentation depends on the location of the lesion, which most commonly affects the paravertebral region and the lower extremities. Metastases are common at presentation, lung and bone being the most frequent sites [2].Histologically, the tumour consists of undifferentiated small round blue cells, that usually contain glycogen. The tumour can be distinguished from other small round cell tumours by immunohistochemical and cytogenetic or molecular analysis [3].Imaging presentation is that of a nonspecific soft-tissue mass with prominent contrast enhancement. Large tumours usually show heterogeneous signal intensity on MR images, due to haemorrhage and necrosis. Tumours are usually hyperintense on T2W images with or without intermediate signal intensity areas, as a result of the high cellularity. Fluid levels might also be seen due to haemorrhage. An imaging feature that is nonspecific but can assist in diagnosis is the presence of serpentine high-flow vascular channels [4]. Surface osseous changes (cortical erosion or periosteal reaction), without evidence of marrow space invasion, have also been described in the adjacent bone [4]. Calcification may be present but is not a typical feature [2].Treatment usually combines chemotherapy and surgery, with or without radiation therapy [1].In conclusion, EES usually affects young patients and reveals an imaging appearance of a nonspecific soft-tissue mass.

He had no other relevant medical history.Emergency abdominal ultrasound was performed.,US (Fig. 1) shows a lobulated predominately cystic mass with thick wall and internal septa located in the left renal sinus.Dynamic 64-MDCT of the lesion was performed in order to further characterize the lesion.Non-enhanced axial CT image (Fig. 2) shows a lobulated isoattenuating mass occupying the left renal sinus.Arterial phase axial CT image (Fig. 3) shows a peripheral nodular enhancement of the lesion with early venous drainage (coronal CT image Fig. 5).Persistent peripheral enhancement in the portal venous phase was observed (Fig. 4).Multiple phleboliths are an uncommon finding (salt and pepper sign).,"Renal haemangioma is a rare benign mesenchymal neoplasm that consists of multiple endothelium-lined, blood-filled vascular spaces [1-5]. Most renal haemangiomas occur as single unilateral tumours without any sex predilection; the peak age group for diagnosis is young to middle-aged adults. The most common locations of haemangiomas in kidney are the medulla and the renal pelvis and most of them are smaller than 2 cm [2, 4]. Larger lesions may cause displacement of the renal vessels and collecting system [2].Haemangioma is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. Symptomatic cases usually present recurrent episodes of haematuria and colicky abdominal pain, hypertension by segmental renal ischaemia and less frequently haematoma (subcapsular or intraparenchymal) [1- 4].Haemangioma is seldom diagnosed before surgery because of its small size and nonspecific imaging findings.Haemangiomas show variable echogenicity on sonography [2].At nonenhanced CT, renal haemangioma may appear as a lobulated hypo- to isoattenuating soft-tissue mass in the region of the renal medulla or pelvis. Multiple phleboliths are an uncommon finding. At nonenhanced MR imaging, haemangiomas are homogeneously hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. After intravenous administration of contrast material, renal haemangiomas demonstrate intense arterial enhancement, persisting into the venous phase at CT and MR imaging. Persistent contrast enhancement on delayed images is fairly characteristic of renal haemangiomas.Haemangioma may rarely masquerade as a cystic renal tumour, with an enhancing solid component, mimicking a cystic renal cell carcinoma [2, 4].At gross pathologic examination, renal haemangioma is an unencapsulated tumour with a spongy red appearance. Histologically, two distinct types of renal haemangioma are recognized: the capillary and cavernous variants. In the kidney, cavernous haemangiomas are more common than the capillary type [1, 2, 5].Treatment options include observation, partial nephrectomy, papillectomy, embolization, and total nephrectomy; the choice of treatment depends on the size of the tumour, its location, and the patient＊s symptoms [2, 3].",Renal haemangiomaCystic renal cell carcinomaOncocytomaRenal abscessAngiosarcoma,Renal haemangioma,5,18088;14720;11532;9995,Area of InterestKidney  ;Imaging TechniqueCTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusPathology;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,186,Renal haemangioma,"{""A"": ""Cystic renal cell carcinoma"", ""B"": ""Oncocytoma"", ""C"": ""Renal abscess"", ""D"": ""Angiosarcoma"", ""E"": ""Renal haemangioma""}",E,Renal haemangioma,C,E,"[""EURORAD/Renal haemangioma/-fpKcCjv.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Renal haemangioma/7L1YHlyX.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Renal haemangioma/eUdBxOyz.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Renal haemangioma/pFTAq0k9.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Renal haemangioma/mjrmaglw.jpg""]","[""Axial unenhanced CT image shows a lobulated isoattenuating mass occupying the left renal sinus (arrow)."", ""Arterial phase axial CT image shows a peripheral globular enhancement of the lesion (arrow)."", ""Axial contrast-enhanced CT image obtained during the portal venous phase shows persistent peripheral enhancement of the lesion (arrow)."", ""US shows a lobulated predominately cystic mass with thick wall and internal septa located in the left renal sinus."", ""Coronal CT image shows a horseshoe kidney (arrow)  and the lesion (asterisk) with peripheral nodular enhancement with early venous drainage.""]"

She reported no relevant medical history.","US presented a 1cm hypoechoic unilocular cyst-like lesion with thin walls, without internal septa, mural nodules or papillary projections, localized in the porta hepatis and showing apparent communication with the common hepatic duct. Doppler evaluation did not demonstrate significant vascularization.MRI images confirmed the presence of a lesion right near the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct. It had a very high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images; fat-sat images excluded the presence of adipous content. Morphological characteristics of the lesion were similar to US finding with round shape and homogeneous signal.The lesion did not show significant contrast enhancement with a lower signal hyperintensity due to the rescaling phenomenon.Surgical excision was performed and histological diagnosis revealed a well-defined mucinous cystic lesion communicating with the left hepatic duct, composed by a single-layered columnar epithelium with mesenchimal ovarian-like stroma.","Biliary cystoadenomas represent the benign type of biliary cystic tumours and were recently classified as mucinous cystic neoplasms in the W.H.O. classification of the biliary tumours [1]. They are uncommon cystic neoplasms that occur most frequently within the liver, while are less common in the extra-hepatic biliary tree or in the gallbladder (< 10%) [2].Histological analysis typically shows multiple loculations but in rare cases they are unilocular; the latter are more frequently intra-hepatic. The cyst may contain serous, mucinous, bilious, haemorrhagic or mixed fluid. They show ovarian-like stroma in the cyst wall [3-4].The clinical presentation is variable and nonspecific, depending on size and location of the lesion: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, upper quadrant palpable mass, jaundice. Occasionally cystoadenomas may be incidentally discovered during abdominal imaging studies. They are more frequent in middle-aged women.Although biliary cystoadenomas are benign tumours, they can progress to cystoadenocarcinomas and may recur after surgical excision [5]. Furthermore cystic lesions of the liver comprise a broad spectrum of pathological entities, ranging from developmental lesions (simple cysts, biliary hamartomatosis, Caroli disease) and inflammatory lesions (abscesses, hydatid cysts) to neoplastic lesions (cystic hepatocellular carcinomas and liver metastases) and rare diseases (intra-hepatic haematomas and bilomas) [6-7].Abdominal radiographs can show hepatomegaly and wall calcifications. US and CT show unilocular or multilocular cyst; the transmission and the attenuation depend on the fluid content (serous, bilious, mucinous or proteinaceous); thin mural nodes and papillary projections may be present. Signs of haemorrhage and calcifications are rarely visible. Septa and soft tissue components of the walls may enhance after the administration of contrast media [3].Also MRI signal can vary with the cystic content, with mucinous cysts showing typical hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Moderate enhancement may be present.Cholangiography is helpful in case of duct dilatation or obstruction and it can demonstrate a communication of the cystadenoma with the biliary tree. The latter can also be demonstrated in the hepatobiliary phase of an MRI using a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent [8].The presence of irregular wall thickening, thick solid nodules and septa, intense enhancement and coarse calcification are suspicious of malignant transformation.If a benign disease is ascertained, observation and/or follow-up examinations can be recommended.

Case number 11678,2014/5/19,https://www.eurorad.org/case/11678,A 45-year-old man presented with shortness of breath and chest pain. A CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CT PA) was ordered for investigation of a pulmonary embolus.,"The CT PA showed a hypodense area in the posterobasal segment of the left lower lobe. This area appears to mimic a bullous lesion in emphysema, however, with vessels extending from it (Fig. 1).An abnormal arterial branch originating from the descending thoracic aorta was also evident (Fig. 2). The venous drainage was not appreciable in any of the images. It was not possible to differentiate whether the lesion was intralobar or extralobar.","Pulmonary sequestration is a segment of non-functioning lung parenchyma which has no connection to the tracheobronchial tree and receives its blood supply from an aberrant systemic artery. Thus, there is no ventilation /perfusion in the sequestrated segment [1, 3].Traditionally, pulmonary sequestrations are divided into intralobar sequestrations (ILS) and extralobar sequestrations (ELS). The two types of sequestrations are similar in their relationship to the bronchial tree and arterial supply but differ in their venous drainage system [2, 4].Pulmonary sequestrations are rare, accounting for approximately 0.15-6.4% of all congenital pulmonary malformations [1, 2, 5].ILS account for approximately 75-85% of all sequestrations and are characterized by development within the visceral pleura, an aberrant systemic artery (usually a branch of the aorta) and venous drainage by the pulmonary veins but can occur through the azygous / hemiazygous vein, portal vein or IVC [3, 5]. ILS usually present in older age with recurrent infections. Infections can occur due to anomalous connections with bronchi, lung parenchyma or the GIT, which can allow bacteria to enter the sequestration [1, 2, 4].ELS account for approximately 15-25% of all sequestrations and are characterized by a separate pleural segment without any lung parenchyma, a small aberrant systemic artery and drainage through the systemic veins or directly in the right atrium [2, 5, 6]. ELS usually present in the neonatal period and can be supradiaphragmatic (90%) or infra-diaphragmatic (10%) [5, 6].On prenatal diagnosis, pulmonary sequestrations are diagnosed on ultrasound as echo dense homogeneous masses. MRI is the best tool in diagnosis of sequestrations and for differential diagnosis amongst other entities, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia and congenital pulmonary airway malformations [5].Postnatal diagnosis of pulmonary sequestrations is initially shown on chest radiographs and clarified best by contrast enhanced helical CT. MRI is particularly helpful in delineating complex lesions and congenital diaphragmatic hernias. Ultrasound may also be very useful in accurate and prompt diagnosis during the neonatal period [6, 7].Surgical treatment is conventionally divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Treatment is considered only for those who are symptomatic such as neonates with ARDS or can be elective for older patients with recurrent infections [8].Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can be used to resect pulmonary sequestrations as long as accurate delineation of the aberrant blood supply can be achieved [8]. 3D CT and MRI are often used prior to surgery to map out the lesion and its blood supply [7, 8].",Pulmonary sequestrationCongenital lobar emphysemaCongenital pulmonary airway malformationBronchogenic cystPulmonary arteriovenous malformation,Pulmonary sequestration,5,15721;11678;11613,Area of InterestLung  ;Imaging TechniqueCT-AngiographyProcedureContrast agent-intravenous;Special FocusEmbolism / Thrombosis;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,194,Incidental finding of pulmonary sequestration,"{""A"": ""Congenital pulmonary airway malformation"", ""B"": ""Bronchogenic cyst"", ""C"": ""Pulmonary sequestration"", ""D"": ""Congenital lobar emphysema"", ""E"": ""Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation""}",C,Pulmonary sequestration,E,C,"[""EURORAD/Incidental finding of pulmonary sequestration/QCt9izy5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Incidental finding of pulmonary sequestration/gadP4Ufz.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Incidental finding of pulmonary sequestration/jHk6QpsU.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Incidental finding of pulmonary sequestration/lTkntqIN.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Incidental finding of pulmonary sequestration/PpTy00Gn.jpg""]","[""Sequestration in left lower lobe (red arrow).

Case number 11692,2014/5/5,https://www.eurorad.org/case/11692,"A 17-year-old male patient presented with a two-day history of periumbilical pain having migrated into the right lower quadrant, associated with vomiting and nausea. There was no previous abdominal surgery or other significant medical history. Blood tests revealed a moderately elevated C-reactive protein (15 mg/l), without leukocytosis.","Abdominal sonography showed a hypoechoic tubular 6 mm blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant, adjacent to the caecum and consistent with a normal appendix (Fig. 1a). A second incompressive tubular structure was visualized in a slightly more cranial location, with a maximal diameter of 17 mm. This second structure contained hyperechoic air as well as hypoechoic debris (Fig. 1b). There were associated enlarged lymph nodes (not shown); no abscess or free air were seen.Intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was then performed, about two hours after oral contrast media administration, showing the second tubular blind-ending structure to be developed from a thickened terminal ileum, with stranding of the surrounding fat and multiple lymph nodes (Fig. 2a, b), consistent with an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. The appendix and the rest of the abdomen were normal (Fig. 2c).The anatomopathological examination showed acute inflammation, perforation and haemorrhagic changes of the Meckel's diverticulum (Fig. 3).","Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract [1, 2]. It is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct, which normally involutes in the embryologic period between 10-12 weeks of gestational age [3]. Meckel's diverticulum contains three intestinal wall layers, making it a true diverticulum. The mucosa may consist either of normal intestinal epithelium or of ectopic gastric mucosa (in 45-80% of cases), in rare cases pancreatic mucosa may be found [4]. The location is variable among individual patients, but the diverticulum's base is usually found 50-100 cm upstream of the ileocecal valve [1, 5]. Its lenght is up to 10 cm. Meckel's diverticulum is present in 2-3% of the general population, with no gender predilection, however, men are more likely to develop complications [4]. Overall, only 4-6% of Meckel's diverticulae become symptomatic, the incidence of complications decreasing with age [4].Typical symptoms of complicated Meckel's diverticulum differ between age groups. Rectal bleeding is the most common presentation in children whereas intestinal obstruction occurs more often in adults [1, 2, 6]. Meckel's diverticulitis is the second most common complication in adults, present in 12-53% of symptomatic patients, caused by acid secretion from ectopic gastric mucosa in the diverticulum or by obstruction, in particular through enteroliths, and subsequent bacterial infection [1, 7].Ultrasound is usually the starting examination for right lower quadrant abdominal pain, in particular to exclude acute appendicitis. Meckel's diverticulitis may lead to misdiagnosis by simulating not only appendicitis symptoms, but also through mimicking its ultrasound apperance [3]. If the inflamed structure's origin cannot be reliably determined by ultrasound, CT with oral and intravenous contrast media usually allows to establish the diagnosis. Positive key features for Meckel's diverticulitis include an origin on the antimesenteric border of the terminal ileum and luminal communication. The presence of thickened mucosa helps differentiate it from an enteric duplication cyst. A persistent omphalomesenteric artery may be followed to its origin from the superior mesenteric artery, this artery being the bleeding source in haemorrhagic diverticulae. A helpful negative key feature is a normal appendix [3].Treatment of Meckel's diverticulitis is surgical, either by open procedure or laparoscopy [1].In conclusion, Meckel's diverticulum is present in 2-3% of the population and rarely becomes symptomatic. Meckel's diverticulitis has to be borne in mind as a clinical and ultrasound mimicker of acute appendicitis.

MRI ordered to investigate suspected lumbar disc herniation.,"MRI of the lumbar spine shows multiple intradural extramedullary masses in the lumbosacral spine. The largest is at L2-L3, sausage-shaped, and measures 11x16x45 mm. Smaller ovoid masses are at L4, L4-L5, and S1. They are heterogeneously hyperintense on T2WI, isointense on T1WI, and intensely enhancing on T1WI C+. They do not protrude into the neural foramina. There are no associated cysts, and there is no associated haemorrhage or scalloping of the vertebral bodies. MRI of the head and complete spine excluded the presence of additional lesions.","Myxopapillary ependymoma (ME) is a slow-growing glioma almost exclusively found in the region of the conus medullaris, filum terminale, and cauda equina [1]. Little is known about its aetiology [2], as it is very rare--227 intradural spinal ependymomas occur in the US annually [3]. The average age at diagnosis is 36.4 years, although the range is 6 to 82 [4], and it is twice as common in men as in women [1]. This neoplasm arises from the ependymal glia of the filum terminale [3] and is highly vascular [2]. It is typically intradural and extramedullary [5] and is grossly ovoid [1], lobular or sausage-shaped, and encapsulated [3]. It is regarded as relatively benign and slow-growing [6], WHO grade I [4], and rarely spreads distantly, although this can happen, particularly if its capsule is perforated [7]. Multiple lesions can be found in 14-43% of cases [8].Clinically, ME mimics discogenic pathology by manifesting as lower back pain [5]--diagnosis is often delayed until 2 years after onset [1]. Radiculopathy [5], sciatica, saddle sensory loss, and bowel dysfunction have been seen in some cases [8]. MRI is the best modality for intraspinal disease [9], and is essential to identifying additional lesions and planning treatment [8].On MRI, the ME is well-circumscribed and generally spans 2-4 vertebral segments [1]. It is T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense [1], although it can be hyperintense on both due to accumulated mucin or haemorrhage [8]. It is intensely enhancing with contrast [1]. It compresses, rather than infiltrates, adjacent structures [10]. 50% of cases are associated with cysts, which contrast helps delineate, and 19% involve haemosiderin deposits suggestive of haemorrhage [11]. Hence, appearance may be heterogeneous. 63% demonstrate osseous changes, such as scalloping of the vertebral bodies or erosion of medial pedicles [11]. It is responsible for 83% of neoplasms involving the filum terminale [8].Complete surgical resection is the optimal treatment [4] and results in excellent prognosis [1]. In subtotal resections or nonsurgical candidates, adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site is recommended to prevent recurrence [12]. After radiotherapy, patients should be followed yearly for 6-8 years [13]. In this patient, the largest lesion was excised, and the others were irradiated. At 8 year follow-up, the irradiated lesions remain but are smaller, and there is no recurrence of the largest lesion.ME is a rare cause of back pain, detectable on MRI, that is the most likely neoplasm in the filum terminale.",Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology)Drop metastasesSchwannomaEpendymomaNeurofibroma,Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology),5,16110;15518;14804;11845;10792,Area of InterestSpine  ;Imaging TechniqueMRProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,204,Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI,"{""A"": ""Ependymoma"", ""B"": ""Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology)"", ""C"": ""Neurofibroma"", ""D"": ""Drop metastases"", ""E"": ""Schwannoma""}",B,Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology),E,B,"[""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/Q3e0L39c.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/T0CtxyTJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/WU0N_VmC.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/x7PKq6ff.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/__sFnwi_.jpg""]","[""T1WI sagittal view of lumbar spine showing isointensity of ependymoma."", ""T1WI C+ sagittal view of lumbar spine showing hetereogeneously contrast-enhancing masses and venous ectasia around the conus medullaris.

Case number 12166,2014/9/14,https://www.eurorad.org/case/12166,"A man without significant medical history sought medical attention at the emergency department because of changed bowel habits, with unremarkable findings at physical examination and plain abdominal radiographs. The attending surgeon requested prompt investigation with water-enema multidetector CT colonography (WE-CTC).","A day later WE-CTC was performed following limited bowel preparation by means of laxative (sennosides) capsules and magnesium citrate solution. After injection of 20 mg hyoscine N-buthylbromide and retrograde distension with 1 litre of warm tap water, the initial contrast-enhanced CT acquisition (Fig. 1) showed well-distended rectosigmoid and descending colon with thin regular walls and haustra, some endoluminal fecal residues. At the transition between the distal transverse colon and splenic flexure, a nondistensible 4.5 cm segment showed imaging features strongly suggesting carcinoma including solid enhancing circumferential mural thickening, abrupt ※shouldering§ transition distally and proximally, and abundant stools upstream.Without moving the patient from the scanner table, after repeated pharmacological hypotonisation and further rectal water instillation a second CT acquisition (Fig. 2) showed optimal distension of most of the large bowel and disappearance of the above-described finding, consistent with a technical artefact (segmental colonic spasm). Subsequent optical colonoscopy confirmed absence of abnormal colonic changes.","Although optical colonoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing diseases of the large bowel, radiologic investigation of the colon is currently performed by means of CT colonography (CTC). Gas CTC (also known as ※virtual colonoscopy§) uses automated or manual insufflation of carbon dioxide or air for colonic distension to detect polyps as part of screening for preneoplastic changes. Alternatively, WE-CTC relies on retrograde colonic filling using water coupled with mural enhancement by intravenous contrast medium, and provides excellent visualization of the enhanced colonic wall, with good contrast between the wall itself, the hypodense lumen, and the pericolonic fat [1]. An increasingly established minimally invasive examination technique, WE-CTC is well tolerated by patients and may be performed with no or limited bowel preparation, requires no special equipment and has a short learning curve for radiologists. Its limited contraindications include toxic megacolon, free perforation, and acute peritonitis. Currently WE-CTC is considered the most accurate imaging modality to provide high-resolution multiplanar visualization of the colonic wall in normal and pathologic conditions, and detailed visualization of associated perivisceral and extraintestinal abnormalities, and may be indicated in patients with suspected or proven colorectal cancer staging [1, 2], rectosigmoid endometriosis [3], diverticulitis and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases [4, 5]. The diagnostic performance of WE-CTC for colon cancer has been validated with reported 98.6% sensitivity and 99.1% negative predictive value, and WE-CTC is considered the best imaging technique for carcinoma staging [6-8].However, CTC results may be hampered by a variety of artefacts and pitfalls, related to suboptimal patient preparation, CT scanning protocol, or perception and interpretation errors. The most important technical pitfalls are represented by fecal residues, particularly when bowel preparation is limited or avoided, and by non-distended bowel segments. Insufficient distension results in luminal narrowing or collapse, most usually involving most of the sigmoid colon and typically related to underlying diverticulosis, and lead to challenging interpretation. As this case exemplifies, persistent focal spasm may occasionally be indistinguishable from a neoplastic stenosis including shoulder formation and positive mural contrast enhancement [9].This report emphasizes the importance of adequate pharmacological hypotonisation during CTC. Although controversial, in our experience administration of spasmolytic drugs such as hyoscine N-buthylbromide or glucagon improves patient comfort, facilitates colonic wall distension and reduces peristalsis, motion artefacts, mural spasms and contraction, thus allowing better assessment of colonic wall thickness and avoiding false diagnoses [9-11].",Segmental colonic spasm (technical artefact) during water enema CT colonographyColon carcinomaLymphomaInfiltration by extracolonic massExtrinsic compressionDiverticulitis,Segmental colonic spasm (technical artefact) during water enema CT colonography,7,12166,"Area of InterestColon,  Cardiac  ;Imaging TechniqueCTProcedureColonography CT;No Special Focus;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,218,The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered,"{""A"": ""Diverticulitis"", ""B"": ""Extrinsic compression"", ""C"": ""Colon carcinoma"", ""D"": ""Lymphoma"", ""E"": ""Segmental colonic spasm (technical artefact) during water enema CT colonography""}",E,Segmental colonic spasm (technical artefact) during water enema CT colonography,C,E,"[""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/VJdydltI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/LIOeH8aj.jpg"", ""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/GJaqWat2.jpg"", ""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/tP7FBh5D.jpg"", ""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/atzxi9KR.jpg"", ""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/b9HsD75N.jpg"", ""EURORAD/The most worrisome CT colonography pitfall I have ever encountered/RpVs12IX.jpg""]","[""Multiplanar reformatted images showed well-distended rectosigmoid and descending colon with thin regular walls and haustra, some endoluminal fecal residues (*) from limited bowel preparation."", ""Between the distal transverse colon and splenic flexure, a 4.5 cm nondistensible segment (arrowheads) showed solid enhancing circumferential mural thickening and abrupt ※shouldering§ transition (thin arrows) distally and proximally.

Case number 12185,2014/11/25,https://www.eurorad.org/case/12185,A 7-year-old girl presented with a large abdominal mass. The mass had been increasing in size over the past month and was associated with abdominal discomfort and weight loss.,"Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a large, ill-defined, mixed solid and cystic vascular mass lesion (Fig. 1a-c). On MR imaging, the lesion was demonstrated to have mass effect on adjacent organs. STIR sequence did not show any fat suppression, suggesting that the contents were fluid (Fig. 2a). Coronal (Fig. 2a) and axial (Fig. 2b) T2w images confirmed the mass to be predominantly cystic. The mass was seen displacing adjacent bowel loops and the mesenteric vessels. The stomach was displaced anteriorly, the spleen superiorly and the pancreas to the right side. The location of the mass was presumed in the retroperitoneum. It was seen in close proximity to the left renal artery. The left renal vein was not identified and was possibly compressed or encased by the mass. Severe left hydronephrosis was noted secondary to mass effect on the proximal left ureter (Fig. 2f).","Nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTSs) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal cell neoplasms that account for about 4% of childhood cancers [1, 4].Soft tissue sarcomas are rare paediatric tumours classified by the WHO according to histologic cell types [2]. 40% are rhabdomyosarcomas and 60% are NRSTS [2]. Paediatric NRSTS behave differently than the adult varieties, hence causing this dilemma [1].The pathogenesis is due to the lack of tumour suppressing genes; p53 and retinoblastoma suppressing gene, resulting in limitless replication, invasion and metastatic growth [1].Four categories of biological potential are included: benign, intermediate每locally aggressive, intermediate每rarely metastasizing, and malignant [1].The types of soft tissue sarcoma based on histology include [2]: Alveolar soft part sarcoma, angiosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, desmoid tumour, desmoplastic small round cell tumour, epithelioid sarcoma, extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, haemangiopericytoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant schwannoma and synovial sarcoma.Ultrasound is the first radiological investigation in the work-up of paediatric abdominal masses. It is inexpensive, readily available, does not involve radiation and seldom requires sedation. Ultrasound identifies the organ of origin as well as the type of tissue components present (solid versus cystic). Magnetic resonance imaging provides excellent soft tissue definition, and is therefore preferable for surgical planning and following neoadjuvant therapy [3, 4, 5]. Staging is best done with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis. PET may be also used, however, it is an optional pretreatment assessment investigation only [6]. Imaging usually shows a soft tissue enhancing mass which may be partly cystic or solid. Histology of the abdominal mass in this patient shows cores of tissue composed of loose interfacing fascicles of plump spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and small nucleoli, surrounded by abundant loose fibrillary and myxoid stroma. No cytological atypia or necrosis is seen. Immunohistochemistry shows strong positivity for vimentin and beta-catenin, as well as patchy positivity for SMA and desmin. S100 and CD56 are negative. Differential diagnosis includes haemangioendothelioma, a liver tumour which may be mistaken for an abdominal mass. Lymphoma may also present as a large abdominal mass encasing the arteries.Treatment options are based on whether the cancer has spread, the amount of tumour left after surgery, and whether the child has reached full growth. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all treatment options, either alone or in combination with one another [2, 3, 4]. This patient was put on weekly Methotrexate plus vinblastine combination.

On physical examination, there was no evidence of sensory loss.","Magnetic resonance imaging of the right foot performed with a high-resolution surface coil. Patient scanned in magnet of 1.5 T. The technical parameters for all magnet strengths were as follows: sagittal, coronal and axial short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) turbo spin echo, coronal turbo spin-echo proton density and T2-weighted and sagittal and coronal turbo spin echo T1-weighted.MR images show marked thickening of the proximal plantar fascia with increased intrasubstance signal intensity. Also perifascial and mild calcaneal marrow oedema.In association with these findings, there is selective fat tissue replacement of the abductor digiti minimi muscle.","Baxter's neuropathy is an entrapment syndrome of the inferior calcaneal nerve (ICN), which is the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve. It accounts for 20% of causes of medial heel pain, occasionally irradiating into the lateral aspect of the foot [1, 2, 3].Atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle reflects chronic compression of the ICN, which consist of loss of muscular mass of the affected muscle with fat tissue replacement (Fig. 1) [4]. MRI plays a key role since nerve entrapment at the foot and ankle involves thin and complex anatomic structures and is underdiagnosed because clinical symptoms and electrophysiologic findings may not contribute to the diagnosis [1]. In addition, opposite to MRI electromyography may not allow differentiation of lateral plantar nerve entrapment at the level of the tarsal tunnel from ICN entrapment [1].Entrapment of the ICN occurs at three possible places: (a) adjacent to the fascial edge of a hypertrophied abductor halluces muscle, (b) as the nerve passes between the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle and the medial caudal margin of the medial head of the quadratus plantae muscle or (c) most commonly where the nerve passes just anterior to the medial calcaneal tuberosity, where it is sometimes related with calcaneal spur and marked thickening of the proximal plantar fascia, as it is shown in our case (Fig. 2) [1, 4].Compression of the ICN may result from altered biomechanics, reflected by posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or Achilles tendinosis, or may result from direct mechanical compression of the nerve due to plantar fasciitis and/or plantar calcaneal spurs (Fig. 3) [2]. Recht et al reported plantar fasciitis in 37% of cases with abductor digiti quinti atrophy [4].Plantar fasciitis is referred in the literature as the most common cause of plantar heel pain [5, 6]. This condition generally occurs in obese middle-aged or elderly patients as a result of repetitive trauma from sport activities, excessive standing and walking [5, 6].In view of the present case, and in order to identify the proper imaging approach to the patient with heel pain, we recommend to assess findings of fatty infiltration of the abductor digiti minimi muscle, since it reflects chronic ICN entrapment.",Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitisIntramuscular abductor digiti minimi lipomaPlantar fibromatosisIsolated plantar fasciitisAbductor digiti minimi atrophy associated with plantar fasciitis (Baxter neuropathy: chronic ICN entrapment),Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis,8,16807;15628;16243;15725;15596;15125;15211;14975;14230;14821;14503;13129;12691;11778;11401;10992;10752;10523;10450;10157;10024;9818;9975;9743;9570,"Area of InterestExtremities,  Musculoskeletal soft tissue,  Neuroradiology peripheral nerve  ;Imaging TechniqueMRProcedureDiagnostic procedure,  Education;Special FocusInflammation;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,261,Baxter\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis,"{""A"": ""Intramuscular abductor digiti minimi lipoma"", ""B"": ""Isolated plantar fasciitis"", ""C"": ""Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis"", ""D"": ""Plantar fibromatosis"", ""E"": ""Abductor digiti minimi atrophy associated with plantar fasciitis (Baxter neuropathy: chronic ICN entrapment)""}",C,Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis,E,C,"[""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/J7bcWkwW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/Sx6M1Tag.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/zx1k8xBJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/JF7nxPsG.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/9RorwZiI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/MmstIwFW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/5JK07dcP.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/MauC1FEw.jpg""]","[""Coronal T1 weighted TSE image shows the normal muscle anatomy.

Case number 12773,2015/10/6,https://www.eurorad.org/case/12773,"A 74-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with one month of jaundice, epigastric pain, fever and weight loss. Laboratory examinations revealed anaemia, elevated hepatic enzymes, elevated bilirubin profile that suggested obstructive jaundice and raised CA 19.9 levels.He had a history of cholecystectomy for lithiasis 40 years before.","The patient presented to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain, fever, weight loss and an orange tint of his urine. Blood workup was consistent with obstructive jaundice and ultrasound examination revealed dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and the common bile duct. He was diagnosed with cholangitis and an elective computed tomography (CT) was ordered.The performed CT scan of the abdomen showed a circumferential, hypovascular and homogeneous wall thickening of the 2nd through the 4th portion of the duodenum of about 20 mm and mucosal folds effacement, suggesting infiltration by a neoplastic process. There were no signs of intestinal obstruction. This duodenal thickening caused biliary and pancreatic ducts dilatation. The circumferential mass did not invade other organs or vessels. Multiple periduodenal and para-aortic adenopathies were also noted.The patient underwent an endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy samples were taken. The histological analysis reported B-cell lymphoma, although a definitive diagnosis was not reached.","Extranodal lymphoma is classified as primary if involvement is confined to a single organ and immediately adjacent lymph nodes. Primary gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma is an uncommon disease, accounting for approximately 20% of all extranodal lymphomas. The distal ileum is the most common site due to its greater amount of lymphoid tissue and just 0.8-2% of all primary GI lymphomas occur in the duodenum [1, 2]. Only 12% of all malignant duodenal neoplasms are duodenal lymphomas [3].The recognized risk factors include immunodeficiency states, notably infection with human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and Helicobacter pylori infection [4].The presenting symptoms are non-specific. Abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are the most frequent. Duodenal malignancies presenting with jaundice due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction occur in 43% of cases, but the exact prevalence of obstructive jaundice in duodenal lymphoma is unknown, although there are a few cases reported [5].Unlike adenocarcinoma, which arises from the mucosa, lymphoma may originate in and extend along the submucosa or the deep mucosal layer, making the diagnosis by endoscopy sometimes difficult.Computed tomography is easy to perform and allows a provisional diagnosis in patients without known disease. In patients with known disease, it provides important information for staging, evaluation of response to therapy, identification of recurrence or complications of therapy.The CT appearance of duodenal lymphoma is variable: aneurysmal, constrictive, nodular and ulcerative infiltration. One of the most common presentations is a diffuse circumferential bulky mass in the duodenal wall, involving a relatively long segment with gradual tapering to a normal mucosa, often associated with regional adenopathies. The tumour may also ulcerate and perforate. Aneurysmal dilatation of the lumen may be seen and excludes other more common causes of duodenal wall neoplastic infiltration, namely adenocarcinoma. Obstruction and infiltration into adjacent structures is uncommon. An intraluminal, polypoid, homogeneous mass without wall thickening or lymphadenopathy has also been described [4, 6-8].Regardless of the morphologic type, the lesions are usually homogeneous, iso or hypodense compared with the normal bowel wall, and hypovascular after contrast media administration [4, 6-8].Although noninvasive imaging plays an important role, a definitive diagnosis always requires biopsy.The modality of treatment depends on the stage of the disease, but many patients are treated with chemoradiation therapy alone. Bypass surgery is done in some cases to relieve the biliary and duodenal obstruction [4].",Duodenal lymphomaLymphomaCarcinomaMetastatic diseaseDuodenitisChronic Crohn\'s disease,Duodenal lymphoma,4,17715;16868;16818;16516;16432;16160;15952;15671;15660;15584;14718;14470;14024;14308;13998;13943;14246;14127;14072;13970;13872;13577;13531;13378;12875;13120;13124;13089;12993;12913;12765;12753;12829;12773;12558;12424;11091;12279;12334;12277;12258;11606;11926;11724;11713;11665;11385;11253;11105;11133;10849;10699;10945;10825;10740;10619;10669;10468;10466;10341;10411;10344;10005;9976;9729;9588;9536;9029,"Area of InterestAbdomen  ;Imaging TechniqueCTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusObstruction / Occlusion,  Lymphoma,  Dilatation;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,268,A rare cause of obstructive jaundice,"{""A"": ""Duodenitis"", ""B"": ""Duodenal lymphoma"", ""C"": ""Chronic Crohn\\'s disease"", ""D"": ""Metastatic disease"", ""E"": ""Carcinoma""}",B,Duodenal lymphoma,E,B,"[""EURORAD/A rare cause of obstructive jaundice/DOk7KT8t.jpg"", ""EURORAD/A rare cause of obstructive jaundice/aH1D36La.jpg"", ""EURORAD/A rare cause of obstructive jaundice/XEsEKgX6.jpg"", ""EURORAD/A rare cause of obstructive jaundice/aL6m59rX.jpg""]","[""Intra-hepatic bile ducts dilatation (arrows)"", ""Common bile duct dilatation (arrowhead) and concentric thickening of the 1st (thick arrow) and 4th (thin arrow) portions of the duodenum."", ""Homogeneous hypodense circumferential thickening of the duodenal wall (arrows), with loco-regional adenopathies (arrowheads)."", ""Intra-hepatic and common bile ducts dilatation (arrows in A) associated with Wirsung duct dilatation (arrow in B) caused by asymmetric circumferential duodenal wall thickening (arrowheads in A).

Case number 12781,2015/12/6,https://www.eurorad.org/case/12781,We present the case of a 9-year-old girl who came to our centre after a first episode of epileptic seizure. The crisis was preceded by headache of some minutes＊ duration. She had no previous relevant medical antecedents.,"Initially the child underwent a CT examination without contrast, which showed a heterogeneous parenchymal lesion with mild vasogenic oedema and higher attenuation areas suggesting possible haemorrhagic deep component. Bone scalloping was easily recognized evaluating the bone window.MRI was performed, showing a mass with ill-defined margins in the right parietal lobe. Superficial small clustered cystic areas were observed reaching the cortical parenchyma with deeper white matter extension. Evident meningeal involvement was noticed after contrast medium injection.","Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a primary brain tumour that occurs in children and young adults, usually in the first three decades of life. It is considered to have a glial origin arising from subpial astrocytes, comprising less than one percent of astrocytomas [1]. That∩s why it is mostly located in the superficial brain cerebral parenchyma and usually involves cortical and leptomeninges, although in some cases it can grow deeply in the brain. Temporal lobes are the most frequent locations followed by parietal and frontal lobes; sometimes it can grow in the thalamus, cerebellous, spinal cord, retina, sellar and pineal region [1]. Recently a new type of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features has been proposed. It is a special type of PXA with high mitotic activity (more than 5 mitosis/10 hpf) and areas of necrosis which are not typical of PXA [2].Dizziness, headache and seizures are usually the clinical presentation in children, adolescents and young adults. Syncopal episodes and visual disturbances have also been described as initial clinical manifestations [3].PXA are more often superficially-located supratentorial masses. Meningeal involvement is typical of PXA and inner table scalloping is frequent. Though they can be only solid, they more usually have a cystic component or present as predominantly cystic masses with mural solid nodules. Their solid components are hypo or isointense on T1 and slightly hyperintense on T2. There is moderate to intense heterogeneous enhancement of solid nodules and thick cystic walls. Their margins can be either well-delimited or undefined [4].Vasogenic surrounding oedema can be present in variable quantity. Haemorrhage can be present in one third of the cases. Calcifications are not usually found but do not exclude the diagnosis.DWI can reveal relatively lower ADCs values and ratios of the solid components than other low-grade tumours [5].PXA is a low-grade tumour with a good prognosis. However, XPA with anaplastic features (up to 20% of PXA will undergo anaplastic transformation) has a worse prognosis because it is associated with parenchymal invasion, necrosis, perivascuar space involvement and thus higher recurrence index after surgery.Mitotic index and total surgery excision are the two most important factors for prognosis.Surgery is the main treatment for XPA. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be considered in patients with uncomplete resections or with anaplastic features.As radiologist, we should consider the diagnosis of XPA in a child or young person with a predominantly cystic superficial cerebral mass with heterogeneous enhancement and especially in addition with meningeal involvement and scalloping of the inner table skull.",Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomaGangliogliomaGangliocytomaDysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumour (DNET)Pilocytic astrocytomaOligodendroglioma,Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma,8,17972;14482;12781;11855,"Area of InterestNeuroradiology brain  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  MRProcedureScreening,  Imaging sequences;Special FocusSeizure disorders;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,269,Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child,"{""A"": ""Pilocytic astrocytoma"", ""B"": ""Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumour (DNET)"", ""C"": ""Gangliocytoma"", ""D"": ""Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma"", ""E"": ""Ganglioglioma""}",D,Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma,B,D,"[""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/b0RFpYZG.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/NAkjE_7-.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/xBJc8zkK.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/GAHMbz_9.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/Cko9qtjW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/EFWLNbC-.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/WV_ivBf3.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic features in a child/IL0jZ5Vm.jpg""]","[""CT: cortical and subcortical lesion with little oedema and probable haemorrhage."", ""CT: bone window.

Case number 13122,2015/9/12,https://www.eurorad.org/case/13122,"A middle-aged G0 woman presented with a past history of uterine myomectomy, spontaneous menopause at 39 years of age, multiple sclerosis, and an allergy to gadolinium contrast medium.  Findings at a routine gynaecological examination one year ago were normal.The patient currently presents with pelvic pain and tenderness, worsening of urinary symptoms related to a neurological disease, without fever.","Confirming physical findings of intense pain at adnexal mobilisation, initial transvaginal ultrasound (Fig.1) showed a sizeable ovoid-shaped multiloculated cystic lesion occupying the right adnexal region, minimal fluid in the peritoneal cul-de-sac, and normal postmenopausal uterus and left ovary. Laboratory results revealed moderately increased (27 mg/L) C-reactive protein.To resolve the gynaecologist's uncertainty between an infectious and neoplastic adnexal mass, the attending radiologist performed an urgent MRI (Fig.2) without gadolinium contrast due to a history of allergy. The 6x4x3.5 cm complex multiloculated adnexal mass showed predominantly fluid signal, septations, minimally thickened peripheral rim, and an absence of haemorrhagic changes. Additionally, the fluid-filled ventral tubular portion consistent with a dilated fallopian tube and extensive parametrial oedema of fat-suppressed images favoured tubo-ovarian abscess over a cystic tumour.Antibiotic therapy resulted in prompt clinical improvement and normalized C-reactive protein. Repeated ultrasound (Fig.3) revealed a decreased size and volume of the complex adnexal mass with increased fluid-like regions, and a disappearance of peritoneal effusion.","Mostly encountered in premenopausal women, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from infection ascending from the vagina to internal genital organs. Risk factors include multiple sexual partners and intrauterine contraceptive devices. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia are the commonest causative organisms, 30%每40% of cases are polymicrobial. Manifestations include pelvic pain, tenderness, fever, mucopurulent discharge. Clinical diagnosis is supported by leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, and confirmed by microscopy of vaginal secretions. The PID spectrum encompasses salpingitis, pyosalpinx and tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) resulting from an increased production of inflammatory exudates, pus and blood. Bilateral involvement is not uncommon. Timely diagnosis and adequate antibiotic therapy allow preventing both progression to complicated forms and long-term sequelae such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pain [1].Ultrasound readily complements clinical examinations in females with acute pelvic complaints. Alternatively, multidetector CT is nowadays often used, particularly when a gynaecologic condition is not initially suspected, sonographic findings are equivocal, pain or ultrasound changes extend beyond the pelvis. Imaging of PID is required in severe presentations or unresponsiveness to treatment, when surgery or abscess drainage are considered. Due to availability of faster scanners and acquisition protocols, MRI is increasingly used and highly helpful for urgent assessment of acute gynaecologic disorders. MRI is particularly attractive for patients with concerns about ionizing radiation and contrast agent use [2-6].Due to its superior soft-tissue contrast, MRI reliably allows categorization of genital lesions according to anatomic location and internal structure. As this case exemplifies, even without intravenous gadolinium, MRI reliably identifies or excludes the presence of blood, depicts dilated pus-filled fallopian tubes as tubular fluid-filled structures, and detects parametrial oedema on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images which suggest pyosalpinx over hydrosalpinx. Further progression of infection causes destruction of normal adnexal structures and formation of TOA, which has a nonspecific, often confusing complex sonographic appearance. MRI shows TOA as a thick-walled, septated heterogeneous mass with high T2 signal intensity corresponding to fluid and internal debris, and restricted diffusion which does not respect anatomic boundaries. Associated changes include parametrial fat inflammation, unspecific free pelvic fluid. Pyosalpinx and TOA display variable T1 signal according to presence of haemorrhagic or proteinaceous material. Post-gadolinium sequences show very strong enhancement of the thickened fallopian tube walls, septa and periphery of TOA, and surrounding inflammatory stranding. Appreciation of the tubular-shaped, serpiginous or tortuous tubal component is useful to differentiate PID from cystic tumours and pelvic abscess of another origin [5, 7-11].",Tubo-ovarian abscessHydrosalpinx in chronic PIDTubal tuberculosisTubal actinomycosisHemorrhagic ovarian cyst / EndometriomaAdnexal torsionFallopian tube carcinomaOvarian cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinomaAbscess from other source (Crohn disease diverticulitis or appendicitis).,Tubo-ovarian abscess,11,13122;12518;10646;11873;9132,"Area of InterestGenital / Reproductive system female  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasound,  MRProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusAbscess;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,297,Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role,"{""A"": ""Tubo-ovarian abscess"", ""B"": ""Tubal tuberculosis"", ""C"": ""Abscess from other source (Crohn disease diverticulitis or appendicitis)."", ""D"": ""Ovarian cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma"", ""E"": ""Hydrosalpinx in chronic PID""}",A,Tubo-ovarian abscess,E,A,"[""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/KxhZVg2k.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/bjTvD2W4.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/o8M0tliR.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/VkfQ_x0K.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/V0jVif12.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/ZAIt4nG-.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/OJdmH1bh.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/q9zO8t2F.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/Vd2mIezc.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/xSLtHMjG.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tubo-ovarian abscess: MRI findings and role/lmKH9-a3.jpg""]","[""A complex multiloculated cystic lesion measuring 55x39x35 mm (Calipers) was seen occupying the right adnexal region.

Case number 13497,2016/3/16,https://www.eurorad.org/case/13497,A 83-year-old male patient was admitted in our institution because of cardiogenic shock and 1-day history of chest pain. Bedside echocardiography was performed by the emergency physician and revealed hyperechoic pericardial effusion.,"We performed a thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) with the suspicion of aortic dissection. Unenhanced thoracic CT revealed pericardial effusion, with high attenuation (>50 UH) suggesting haemopericardium (Figure 1).Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT at arterial phase showed a defect in the ventricular septum (Figure 2). Thoracic CT with 70 seconds delay demonstrated hypoenhancement in the inferobasal region of the ventricular septum, where the rupture was seen, consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (Figure 3).Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT also showed contrast reflux into hepatic veins suggesting right-ventricular failure (Figure 4).","Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) is a rare but lethal complication of AMI, with an incidence of 0.17 to 0.31% in patients receiving early thrombolytic therapy for AMI [1], which is substantially lower than prethrombolytic era rates of 1-2% [2].Risk factors for VSR in patients presenting with AMI are older age, female sex, prior stroke, chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure [2].Rupture develops after transmural infarction of the ventricular septum, causing necrosis of the myocardium and weakening of the tissues [3]. Subsequent rupture causes a left-to-right shunt from the high-pressure left ventricle (LV) to the lower-pressure right ventricle (RV), resulting in volume overload of the RV with diminished systolic function.The median time from AMI to VSR is generally 24 hours or less in patients treated with thrombolytic agents and percutaneous coronary intervention, but later onset is still seen [2].Patients classically present with biventricular failure and severe haemodynamic instability in the setting of recent AMI [2]. Other physical examination findings may include systolic murmum over the precordium as well as a palpable thrill.When VSR is suspected, the diagnosis is made by a prompt echocardiography with Doppler colour flow imaging, showing defect of the ventricular septum and demonstration of flow across the septum.CT study is usually not necessary for diagnosis of VSR, but in this case we first suspected aortic dissection. Therefore, only few cases of acute VSR revealed by CT have been reported. CT findings in VSR include: septal defect, signs of right heart failure such as right-ventricular dilatation and contrast reflux into the inferior cave and hepatic veins, haemopericardium.Medical management of VSR is afterload reduction to increase effective LV stroke volume by reducing the degree of shunt. Intraaortic ballon pump counterpulsation is effective for reducing afterload and increasing cardiac output [4].Definitive treatment requires surgical repair of the ruptured septum. Current guidelines of the American College of Cardiology每American Heart Association for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction recommend immediate operative intervention in patients with septal rupture, regardless of their clinical status [5].",Ventricular septal rupture.Ventricular free wall rupturePapillary muscle ruptureLeft ventricular aneursymAcute mitral regurgitationAortic dissection,Ventricular septal rupture.,4,15382;13497;10676,"Area of InterestCardiac,  Veins / Vena cava  ;Imaging TechniqueCTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusIschaemia / Infarction;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,333,Ventricular septal rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction,"{""A"": ""Ventricular septal rupture."", ""B"": ""Ventricular free wall rupture"", ""C"": ""Left ventricular aneursym"", ""D"": ""Aortic dissection"", ""E"": ""Papillary muscle rupture""}",A,Ventricular septal rupture.,B,A,"[""EURORAD/Ventricular septal rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction/VtGZJY8D.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Ventricular septal rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction/gRzSKxfR.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Ventricular septal rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction/ByFw9KU8.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Ventricular septal rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction/O3Ze4rHG.jpg""]","[""Axial non-enhanced thoracic CT revealing pericardial effusion with high attenuation suggesting haemopericardium."", ""Short-axis view of contrast-enhanced thoracic CT at arterial phase showing a defect in the interventricular septum (arrow)."", ""Axial thoracic CT with 70 seconds delay demonstrating hypoenhancement in the inferobasal region of the ventricular septum consistent with acute myocardial infarction (arrow)"", ""Axial contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showing contrast reflux into hepatic veins suggesting right-ventricular failure.""]"
Case number 13534,2016/12/4,https://www.eurorad.org/case/13534,An ultrasound (US) examination of the left axilla was requested to evaluate a sudden appearing nodular axillary tumefaction in a 35-year-old woman in her first day of the puerperium. No other inflammatory signs were apparent and the patient denied any accompanying symptoms such as fever or local pain.,"The US examination of the left axilla (performed with a high frequency linear array transducer) showed multiple tubular anechoic structures admixed with echogenic vascularized tissue in between, globally measuring 38x21x11mm (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). A smaller amount of tissue (12x5x3mm) with similar echotexture was found at the contralateral axilla. These findings were considered compatible with ectopic axillary breast tissue with prominent lactating ducts and a careful clinical observation was performed subsequently revealing several supernumerary nipples along the left and right milk lines that were previously not noticed by the patient (Fig. 3, 4 and 5).","BackgroundPolymastia, supernumerary breasts, accessory breasts and ectopic breast tissue are all synonyms designating the presence of more than two breasts in humans [1]. This variant can occur at up to 6% of the population, more frequently in the axilla, although it may appear in any location along the milk line [2] extending from the axilla to the external genitalia [3] or even in locations outside the mammary ridge, such as the face, posterior neck, middle back, hip, shoulder, upper extremities and posterior and lateral thigh [2]. A classification system (comprising 8 classes) for supernumerary breast tissue created by Kajava in 1915 is still applied today [1] and it is based on which elements are present in the accessory breast tissue (nipple, areola, glandular tissue, hair) and their possible combinations. Our case is a class 2, consisting of glandular tissue with a nipple and without an areola.Clinical PerspectiveEctopic breast tissue is under the same hormonal influences and risk of disease as normally located breast tissue [4]. Lactational changes can occur in ectopic breast tissue [4], as in our case, and this variant should not be misdiagnosed as pathological. Apart from the physiological and pathological (benign and malignant) conditions that can occur in ectopic breast tissue, this entity is sometimes associated with congenital anomalies of the urogenital system [2].Imaging PerspectiveThe differential diagnosis of sudden appearing axillary tumefaction in a lactating woman should include the hypothesis of ectopic axillary breast tissue.On US, mammography and magnetic resonance (MR), accessory breast tissue has the same imaging appearance of eutopic breast tissue [4].US is the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate breast disorders in pregnant and lactating women [5]. The US features of the lactating breast include a prominent ductal system (due to milk secretion) and an increased vascularity on color Doppler [5], both observed in our case of ectopic breast tissue.Overall, mammography has a decreased sensitivity in the lactating breast due to its increased density, nevertheless it may be helpful if malignancy is suspected. MR is controversial and difficult to interpret because of the pattern of enhancement of the lactating parenchyma and its diffuse high signal on T2-weighted sequences. [5]OutcomeMost patients with accessory breast tissue are asymptomatic. If required, surgical treatment is the option for cosmetic and physical discomfort reasons. Management of accessory breast tissue cancer should follow the recommendations for pectoral breast cancer of parallel TNM classification [2].",Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipplesUS features are typical of normal lactating breast tissue in an ectopic location (axilla).Differential diagnosisbefore US examination: lymphadenopathyabscess.,Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples,5,13534,"Area of InterestBreast  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasound,  Image manipulation / ReconstructionProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusObstetrics;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,336,Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples along the milk line in a puerpera,"{""A"": ""abscess."", ""B"": ""US features are typical of normal lactating breast tissue in an ectopic location (axilla)."", ""C"": ""Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples"", ""D"": ""before US examination: lymphadenopathy"", ""E"": ""Differential diagnosis""}",C,Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples,B,C,"[""EURORAD/Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples along the milk line in a puerpera/2tE5t6QD.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples along the milk line in a puerpera/Y8Ibcj-B.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples along the milk line in a puerpera/gnGKv3Sb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples along the milk line in a puerpera/ll9ASJ2i.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Lactating accessory axillary breast tissue with supernumerary nipples along the milk line in a puerpera/R58gRZgz.jpg""]","[""Longitudinal plane of the left axilla, depicting several tubular anechoic structures compatible with lactating milk ducts, with a vascularized stroma between them."", ""Axial plane of the left axilla depicting similar findings to those in Fig. 1."", ""The clinically detected tumefaction, with a nipple in its center, is shown.

Case number 13775,2016/8/16,https://www.eurorad.org/case/13775,"A 47-year-old woman was referred for an incidentally detected non-cystic left adnexal mass on ultrasound examination. Laboratory analysis, including tumour markers was unremarkable. MRI examination of the pelvis followed.","MRI revealed the presence of a unilocular, heterogeneous, sharply-defined mass originating from the left adnexa (Fig. 1). The dimensions of the mass were 77℅85℅73 mm. A fluid-fluid level and a heterogeneous floating solid part were detected within the lesion. The intracystic nondependent fluid and part of the floating mass showed high signal intensity on both T1 (Fig. 1a) and T2-weighted images (Fig. 1b), approximating that of fat. Suppression of the high-signal intensity of the lesion was observed on fat saturated T1-weighted images (Fig. 1c). On DW images, the same components demonstrated severely restricted diffusion (Fig. 1d). The uterus and the right ovary were normal. No intravenous contrast medium was given.Despite the lesion＊s restricted diffusion, conventional MRI findings, namely hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and signal decrease on fat-saturated T1-weighted sequences were considered diagnostic for mature cystic teratoma.","MRI diagnosis was subsequently confirmed on pathology, following cyst excision.Mature cystic teratoma (MCT, also known as dermoid cyst) is the most common benign ovarian tumour in women less than 45 years of age [3]. MCTs are cystic tumours composed of well-differentiated derivations from at least two of the three embryonic germ cell layers. The gross pathologic appearance is characteristic. These tumours are unilocular in 88% of cases, filled with sebaceous material and lined with squamous epithelium. Hair follicles, skin glands, muscle and other tissues lie within the wall. Furthermore, there is usually a raised protuberance projecting into the cyst cavity known as the Rokitansky nodule, which gives rise to most of the hair and may contain fat, bone and teeth. Fat-fluid levels may also be detected [1-4].Imaging diagnosis of MCT is usually straightforward on conventional MRI, due to the presence of fat. Specifically, the sebaceous component has very high T1 signal, similar to that of fat and intermediate to high T2 signal. Sequences with frequency-selective fat saturation will suppress the high signal of teratomas, confirming the diagnosis [1-7]. Based on the ESUR guidelines, contrast-enhanced imaging is not recommended for the diagnosis of MCTs. T1 ＆hyperintense＊ masses require fat-suppressed T1WI using chemical presaturation to suggest the diagnosis of MCT [8].The additional diagnostic contribution of DWI in differentiating benign from malignant cystic adnexal lesions remains controversial [9-15]. Low ADC may be seen in many benign cystic adnexal masses, such as MCTs, endometriomas, haemorrhagic functional ovarian cysts and cysts that contain dense mucinous material [9-15]. MCTs exhibit lower ADC compared to other benign or malignant cystic adnexal lesions for two reasons. DWI with EPI sequences usually uses a fat saturation RF pulse, so that the signal intensities of fat are suppressed and measurements of ADC become extremely low. Moreover, the presence of keratinoid substance within the tumour results in restricted diffusion [9-15]. The above characteristics may also create difficulties in the early detection of malignant transformation of MCTs [13].It is important to be familiar with the DWI characteristics of MCTs to avoid misinterpretation, although these tumours may be accurately diagnosed when DW images are interpreted in conjunction with conventional T1, fat-suppressed T1 and T2-weighted MR images. However, although DWI restriction is not mandatory for the diagnosis of MCT, it can be affirmative. DWI may also add useful differential diagnostic information in patients with fatless MCTs [9, 13-15].",Mature cystic ovarian teratomaImmature teratomaEndometriomaHaemorrhagic ovarian cystPedunculated lipoleiomyoma of the uterusOvarian serous or mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma,Mature cystic ovarian teratoma,4,13775;13585;13305;12733;10745;10442;10273,"Area of InterestGenital / Reproductive system female  ;Imaging TechniqueMR,  MR-Diffusion/PerfusionProcedureComparative studies;Special FocusNeoplasia;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,362,Ovarian mature cystic teratoma: MR imaging findings,"{""A"": ""Ovarian serous or mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma"", ""B"": ""Mature cystic ovarian teratoma"", ""C"": ""Pedunculated lipoleiomyoma of the uterus"", ""D"": ""Haemorrhagic ovarian cyst"", ""E"": ""Immature teratoma""}",B,Mature cystic ovarian teratoma,C,B,"[""EURORAD/Ovarian mature cystic teratoma: MR imaging findings/a6pJ3aLm.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Ovarian mature cystic teratoma: MR imaging findings/ZR04or9Y.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Ovarian mature cystic teratoma: MR imaging findings/6K9tomG9.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Ovarian mature cystic teratoma: MR imaging findings/MzsIaa3z.jpg""]","[""Axial T1-weighted image shows a left adnexal mass (arrow) with a fluid-fluid level and a floating solid element (long arrow), the latter corresponding to Rokitansky nodule on histology.

Case number 14455,2017/2/23,https://www.eurorad.org/case/14455,"A 53-year-old male presented with a mildly painful right thigh swelling for the past three months. There was no history of trauma, surgery or additional diseases.On physical examination, a palpable mass was noted with an approximated length of 6cm and there were no signs of inflammation of the skin or lymphadenopathies.","Initially, a US was performed revealing a large multilocular cystic mass, with some echogenic debris inside. It was localized in the medial side of the right thigh and showed no significant Doppler signal (figure 1).On MRI, a well-defined multicystic encapsulated mass was found on the right adductor muscles. Measuring 6, 9 x 6, 7 x 18, 2 cm (antero-posterior x transversal x longitudinal), it showed homogeneous low signal characteristics on T1-weighted images and very high signal on T2-weighted images, separated by thick septa, with no solid component (figure 2). On T1-weigthed images and fat suppressed T1-weighted images, the lesion had no loss of signal intensity (figure 3). Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images only showed enhancement of the peripheral capsule (figure 4).Adjacent to the lesion, smaller rounded cysts were found, compatible with daughter cysts (figure 5). No apparent relation with neurovascular or bone structures were found.","Hydatid disease (HD) is an endemic infestation caused by the tapeworms of the echinococcus, humans being accidental hosts in their life cycle. Found in the intestine of carnivores, when humans are infected, the development of a hydatid form occurs, especially in the liver and lungs [1].HD can be either primary or secondary. In the secondary form, there is an actual or previous primary location of a hydatid cyst in the liver, lung or spleen. Primary muscular localization of HD represents 0,9% of cases [2], not only because the sole implantation at this localization involves passage through the filters of the liver and lung but also due to muscle contractility and presence of lactic acid. The muscle volume and its rich blood supply could explain predilection for proximal muscles of the lower limbs [3].The symptoms include a slow-growing soft tissue mass, which can be associated with pain or inflammatory signs.Imaging modalities play a major role in the diagnosis of these lesions. The first, most affordable and noninvasive exam to perform is Ultrasound, where the presence of cystic formations with daughter cysts, detached membranes and double-line sign are the characteristic features of these lesions. The sensitivity of US is 95% and can reach 100% if vesicular fibrils are present [4].Gharbi classification based on their ultrasound features, divides them into 5 types [5]:?	I每Unilocular unechoic cystic lesion with double line sign?	II每Fluid collection with a split wall (water lily sign)?	III每Fluid collection with multiple septa/and/or daughter cyst (honeycomb sign)?	IV每Heterogeneous cyst contents with internal echoes?	V每Cyst with reflecting calcified thick wallComputed tomography appearance can range from a unilocular cyst to a complex or a solid lesion, mimicking a tumour. On CT one can depict wall calcifications, the presence of daughter cysts and detached membranes [6].Magnetic resonance imaging T2 sequences show a multilocular cystic formation with low intensity rim, representing the pericyst, which is rich in collagen and is generated by the parasite. A low-intensity rim (rim sign), seen on both T2 and T1 sequences, is a characteristic sign in muscular HD. A feature that is rarely found in HCs located in other regions of the body [7].Complete surgical removal of the cyst remains the primary treatment option [8].HD imaging features contribute to the pre-operative diagnosis and can also prevent the use of aggressive diagnostic tools such as fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy, thus reducing the risk of anaphylactic shock or dissemination of viable parasites [9].",Primary Muscle Hydatid DiseaseNecrotic Malignant Soft Tissue TumorsAbscessLymphangiomaSynovial CystChronic Hematoma,Primary Muscle Hydatid Disease,8,15931;15639;14455;12493;11433,"Area of InterestMusculoskeletal soft tissue  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasound-Colour Doppler,  MR,  PACSProcedureEducation,  Surgery;Special FocusCysts;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,401,Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst,"{""A"": ""Primary Muscle Hydatid Disease"", ""B"": ""Lymphangioma"", ""C"": ""Necrotic Malignant Soft Tissue Tumors"", ""D"": ""Chronic Hematoma"", ""E"": ""Synovial Cyst""}",A,Primary Muscle Hydatid Disease,B,A,"[""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/LN-ILYlb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/6fpmbG_R.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/KGNly1bX.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/4wCxAna9.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/lTBdAVG3.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/PRZWt2lC.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/HE18I_qF.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Not Your Every Day Hydatid Cyst/Vf3Q10aR.jpg""]","[""Ultrasound axial image of a multicystic lesion in the thigh with simple cysts and some with ecogenic debris inside.

His symptoms aggravated during sports involving continuous hand movements, such as badminton. On examination, there was hypoesthesia in the median nerve distribution.","Initially, X-ray is advised for the right wrist, and it showed no obvious abnormality (Fig. 1).Also a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of right hand with wrist was completed, and it revealed an intraneural lesion measuring approximately 10 x 5 mm with intralesional bleed in the median nerve in the carpal tunnel region. The lesion demonstrated iso to high signal intensity on T1W and hyperintensity on T2W and STIR sequences (Fig. 2, 3, and 4). On gradient echo image blooming was seen within the lesion suggestive of intralesional bleed (Fig. 5). On post-contrast examination, lesion showed significant heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6).On histopathology the lesion was composed of intercommunicating ecstatic venous channels separated by thin fibrous stroma (Fig. 8). The lesion also showed medium to large cavernous spaces lined by a single layer of flattened endothelial cells with RBC's in lumen [2] (Fig. 9). Verhoeff-van Gieson stain for elastic fibres was negative (Fig. 10). Hence it was confirmed to be intraneural venous malformation of the median nerve [1].","Venous malformations of the median nerve are uncommon with only two cases being reported until now [1, 3]. These cases presented with features of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome [1].Venous malformations comprise of masses of veins and venules lined by a single endothelial layer [2, 4] and they tend to form thrombosis often lead to forming phleboliths that are pathognomonic of venous malformations [5].Ultrasound with color Doppler is the preferred diagnostic modality. MRI study is used to see the extent of lesion [5, 6]. However, plain MRI is not very sensitive in identifying small and deep venous malformations. Angiography can be useful in such cases [7].The location and extent of the lesion determines the basis of treatment [1, 5]. Cryotherapy, sclerotherapy and laser therapy are used in treating the venous malformations but not effective in treating intraneural venous malformations [1].

Case number 15315,2017/12/27,https://www.eurorad.org/case/15315,"The patient was referred by the GP to the ED for thoracic pain irradiating to the left arm.There were multiple cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, 7 pack-years, positive family history).A clinical question: Stenosis?","Rare congenital variant: mono coronary originating from the non-coronary cusp.The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) courses from the right atrioventricular (AV) groove anterior of the pulmonary trunk to the anterior interventricular groove (prepulmonic course).The left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) courses posterior to the aorta from the right AV groove to the left AV groove (retro-aortic course).No interatrial ""malignant"" course. No acute angle takeoff, slitlike orifice nor an intramural segment. No significant coronary stenosis.","A. Multiple courses of anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) are known: retro-aortic, prepulmonic, transseptal and interarterial. [1]Of these four variants, only the interarterial course is a cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD), the exact pathophysiology is not elucidated, because a normal pulmonary artery is not likely to exert enough pressure to occlude an interarterial coronary artery. [2] Right ACAOS is more frequent than left ACAOS, but has a weaker association with SCD.An intramural segment, another associated anatomical variant, is probably the most predisposing factor to sudden cardiac death. [3]It is defined as a proximal segment of the coronary artery located in the 'media' of the aortic wall without an intervening adventitia. [4]B. Ischaemia (and possibly SCD) occurs when expansion of the great vessels during exercise leads to occlusion of the slitlike ostium and stretching of the acute course of the coronary artery. [2]The onset of symptoms later in life is related to the development of hypertension, aortic root dilatation and increased stroke volume. [5]C. Key findings are a slitlike orifice, an acute angle takeoff and a stretched intramural segment.CT angiography is the examination of choice for detection of an intramural segment due to the multiplanar capabilities. An abnormal elliptical cross section proximally (height-to-width ratio greater than 1,3) with normal round luminal shape more distally allows diagnosis of an intramural segment. [6]D. In our case biochemistry showed negative troponins and D-dimer tests, ECG showed anteroseptal QS pattern with slight J-point elevation in V1-V3 and echocardiography showed normal LV and RV contractility and function, slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.No arguments for active cardiac ischaemia were retained and low dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was prescribed. Elective CT angiography was planned because of the suspicious symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors. Since there was no malignant course and no coronary calcifications or stenosis, acetylsalicylic acid was ceased. The symptoms were thought to be related to coronary spasm and a calcium channel blocker was prescribed if symptoms would recur.E. Describe anatomic variants (ACAOS and interarterial course). Search for a slitlike orifice, acute angle of origin and intramural segment because these carry an even higher risk of sudden cardiac death and the latter can be treated with coronary unroofing.

Simultaneously, NHL characteristics are referred to be symptomatic splenomegaly in advanced stages and a rare manifestation is an autoimmune characteristic like autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopaenia, circulating anticoagulants.The main imaging patterns are splenomegaly (without a discrete mass), splenomegaly with diffuse infiltration, solitary mass (with necrosis or invasion of the splenic capsule), 2-10 cm miliary lesions, multifocal nodules (which differentiate from splenic infarcts and fungal abscesses). [2, 3]The most-used imaging methods for evaluation of splenic pathology are US and CT. Characteristic findings in US are enlarged spleen with hypoechoic, heterogeneous mass and the presence of ※target sign§. [4] On CT splenic lymphoma appears as splenomegaly containing a round mass which is usually hypodense and also one or more nodules. Sometimes infiltration of splenic artery is seen. MRI has a similar accuracy to CT, but with decreased sensitivity. [5] The low sensitivity of MRI is due to the similar relaxation times of normal splenic tissue and lymphoma.

He was in a good clinical state, and no other associated signs or symptoms were present.","An AP radiograph of the right humerus revealed an extensive permeative lesion of the medullary bone and a discontinuous periosteal reaction (Fig. 1), findings consistent with a lesion of aggressive biological behaviour (leukaemia, lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteomyelitis, or metastasis of a neuroblastoma).An MRI of the right humerus showed a bone lesion that extended from the proximal metaphysis to the distal diaphysis of the right humerus (Fig. 2a). The lesion had an associated soft tissue mass and both the bony and the soft tissue lesions were hyperintense on the STIR sequence (Fig. 2a), hypointense on T1-weighted sequences (Fig. 2b), and showed intense and heterogeneous enhancement after administration of intravenous contrast (Fig. 2c, 2d).Therefore, a biopsy was performed, whose result was consistent with a neuroblastoma metastasis (Fig. 3). There was no N-myc amplification. The primary tumour was not found on either whole body MRI or on an MIBG scan.","Neuroblastoma is a tumour that derives from the primordial neural crest cells that form the sympathetic nervous system. It constitutes the most common solid extra-cranial malignancy in children, with a median age at diagnosis of around 16 months, and 95% of cases being diagnosed by 7 years of age. Its main feature is its variable biological behaviour, with tumours being potentially lethal and others undergoing spontaneous regression without any treatment [1].The main prognostic factor of this neoplasm is its presurgical stage. This is because complete resection of the tumour is key for the survival of these patients, and the more advanced the disease, the poorer the prognosis. The presence of N-myc amplification also gives a worse prognosis. In high risk patients, other treatments are considered. In our case, the patient was treated with chemotherapy and auto stem cell transplant, and has had no relapse until now (two years later).Neuroblastoma metastases are very prevalent, with bone marrow (70%), bone (55%), and liver being the most affected sites [1]. Bone metastases most commonly present with pain and swelling. They typically occur in the long bones of the extremities [2], skull, and bony orbit, for which this tumour has an unexplained predilection to metastasise [3].The radiological appearance of bone metastases of neuroblastoma is variable, even though it often reflects its aggressive behaviour: in the skull, it typically manifests as thickening of the bone (the so-called ※hair-on-end§ periosteal reaction) or lytic defects and separation of sutures [4], whereas in long bones, it tends to present as a permeative lesion with an aggressive periosteal reaction, or even as pathological fractures [3, 4].Nevertheless, this pattern is not specific, and in children, it may be also seen in other conditions such as osteomyelitis, Ewing sarcoma, lymphoma or leukaemia [5].On MRI, bone metastases of neuroblastoma are seen as hyperintense on STIR and show intense enhancement after the administration of intravenous contrast, and this imaging technique is an effective method for their depiction in the appropriate clinical setting [4].The presence of neuroblastoma metastases in the absence of an identifiable primary tumour is extremely uncommon, with only seventeen cases having been reported in literature [6, 7, 8]. However, due to the prevalence of this tumour in the paediatric population, it should always be included in the differential diagnosis of an aggressive lesion in the long bone of a child.",Bone metastasis of neuroblastoma.LeukaemiaLymphomaEwing sarcomaOsteomyelitisLangerhans cell histiocytosisOsseous rhabdomyosarcomaOsteosarcomaBone metastasis of neuroblastoma,Bone metastasis of neuroblastoma.,8,15699;14890;14686;13455;13302;10570,"Area of InterestPaediatric  ;Imaging TechniqueConventional radiography,  MR,  PercutaneousProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,484,Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma,"{""A"": ""Ewing sarcoma"", ""B"": ""Lymphoma"", ""C"": ""Bone metastasis of neuroblastoma."", ""D"": ""Langerhans cell histiocytosis"", ""E"": ""Osteosarcoma""}",C,Bone metastasis of neuroblastoma.,A,C,"[""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/hJZsbBdJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/7ourmU-R.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/1UOsipMm.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/4RQpgoe1.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/0DBf1Yrq.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/xJUL3WD6.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/LEUFxCkg.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Bone metastasis of primitive occult neuroblastoma/iV9z-ylU.jpg""]","[""There is a permeative lesion in the medulla of the proximal and medial right humerus (white arrows) as well as a extensive discontinuous periosteal reaction of the proximal and medial humeral diaphysis (black arrows)."", ""Coronal STIR.\nThere is marked hyperintensity of the bone and soft tissue lesions (asterisk and arrow respectively).

It typically affects children or adolescents with no gender predilection [1]. Exact pathogenesis of the disease is unknown; although it is thought that a T cell mediated autoimmune response to myelin basic protein, triggered by an infection or vaccination, underlies its pathogenesis.Clinical manifestations appear 1-2 weeks after a viral infection or vaccination. The most characteristic features are the development of multifocal neurological symptoms (ataxia, tremor, optic neuritis, convulsions...) with a variable prodromal phase consisting of headache, fever and nausea with vomiting. [2]Unlike multiple sclerosis, ADEM usually course as a monophasic disease. In fact, any new or fluctuating symptoms during the first 3 months are considered to be part of the same event. Appearance of new lesions at MRI suggests the diagnosis of multiphasic ADEM or multiple sclerosis (MS).Diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is based on clinical and radiological features because there is no specific biological marker or confirmatory test.In acute phase, CT can be unremarkable in up to 40% of the cases.Conventional MRI demonstrate at FLAIR and T2 WI patchy areas of increased signal intensity involving white and gray matter, particularly basal ganglia, thalami and brainstem. Lesions tend to be multiple, bilateral and with no mass effect. Compared to MS, ADEM lesions tend to be more rounded and larger with poorly defined margins. Corpus callosum involvement is more characteristic of MS; meanwhile thalamic participation is more typical of ADEM [3, 4].Spinal cord lesions are common and affect multiple segments.Treatment consists of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin or cyclophosphamide for refractory patients.

Digital rectal examination confirmed a friable soft tissue mass. Clinical history and remainder physical examination were unremarkable. Blood investigation revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was within the normal range.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a solid, homogeneous and hypoechoic tumour in the anorectal junction (Fig.1). Due to the patient's painful, it was not possible to cross the tumour with the probe. The tumour invaded the submucosa, but no muscular invasion or mesorectal lymph node metastases were observed.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed for further characterization and local staging, confirmed a solid polypoid lesion in the anorectal junction. The hypointense line corresponding to muscularis propria was intact and no internal sphincter invasion was observed. The tumour demonstrated high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. On diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) the tumour demonstrated restricted diffusion, represented by high signal intensity on b 1000 s/mm2 and corresponding low signal on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map.","Primary anorectal melanoma is a rare malignancy comprising less than 1% of all melanomas and 0, 25-1, 25% of all anorectal malignancies. The disease typically affects Caucasians between the fifth and eight decades of life and its incidence has doubled in the past 20 years in Western countries. The prognosis remains poor with a five-year survival rate of 10-15% [1, 2].Rectal bleeding is the most common presentation but non-specific symptoms such as anal pain, tenesmus or pruritus are frequently referred. The disease is confused with benign entities (haemorrhoids or polyps) and the diagnosis is usually delayed [1-3].The pathophysiology of primary anorectal melanoma remains unclear. It arises from melanocytes present in the mucosa and some studies suggest that there is a role of activating KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase in its pathogenesis [3].Primary anorectal melanoma is more commonly located in the anal canal or close to pectinate line, extending along the submucosal plane proximally towards rectum, simulating a primary rectal tumour. Rarely, tumours arise in the rectum itself. The evaluation of the primitivity includes the presence of a single lesion, the absence of other primary locations and the absence of previous removal of melanoma or atypical melanocytic lesions [4].Different imaging techniques are used to evaluate primary anorectal melanoma, metastasis and treatment responses. EUS is helpful to differentiate between solid and cystic lesions and to evaluate the lesion size, location and depth of bowel wall invasion. MRI is widely used as the diagnostic modality for anorectal abnormalities and is recommend for local staging of malignancies. On MRI, anorectal melanoma usually presents as an intraluminal polypoid mass that not causes obstruction. Due to its paramagnetic feature, the melanotic component of melanomas shorts the T1 relaxation time and increase the T2 relaxation time, which results in high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. These tumours usually show moderate to strong enhancement and diffusion restriction. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography is recommended for systemic staging and for response assessment due to its high sensitivity and specificity [2, 5].Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment and includes wide local excision, endoscopic mucosal resection or abdomino-perineal resection. Sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended before inguinal lymph node dissection, although it is not predictive of prognosis.

On clinical examination there was weakness in abduction of the hip on the right side. No obvious cause was identified.","MRI was used to confirm the diagnosis of right superior gluteal nerve impingement in this case. Coronal and sagittal images from T1 weighted and STIR sequences are displayed highlighting subacute superior gluteal nerve impingement. Using MRI, it was not possible to directly visualise the nerve entrapment. However, the nerve impingement was indirectly visualised as hyper-intensity of right tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles on STIR sequences (Fig 1, Fig 2 and Fig 3). On T1 weighted images there was mild increase in signal intensity in right tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus, indicating fatty changes (Fig 4, Fig 5 and Fig 6).","The superior gluteal nerve (SGN) is formed by the posterior roots of L4, L5, and S1 [1]. It exits the pelvis between the upper surface of the piriformis muscle and osseous border of the greater sciatic foramen; entering the deep gluteal space [1]. As the SGN supplies motor branches to the gluteus medius and minimus, nerve injury usually manifests as weakness in abduction of the hip and a Trendelenburg gait [1]. It doesn＊t have any sensory branches [2].Injury to the SGN is common during the direct lateral approach to the hip during arthroplasty [3, 4, 5], due to local buttock trauma, pelvic fracture, and after buttock injections [6, 7]. It may also occur due to compression by anterior-superior tendinous fibers of the piriformis muscle [8] or by prominent osteophytes, bony excrescences related to fractures, and infectious and inflammatory processes, as it exits the pelvis [9].MRI is the imaging modality of choice with regards to the presence, extent of and site of nerve injury, and differentiating between surgically treatable and untreatable causes [1, 10]. The degree and duration of injury determines the extent of neural recovery [9].The SGN can be seen on coronal and sagittal images as it exits the pelvis, along the bony brim, in the suprapiriformis foramen [1, 9], and on axial images as it travels laterally through the fat plane between the gluteus minimus and medius muscles [1]. On T1-weighted MR images, nerves have intermediate signal intensity, while being isointense or mildly hyperintense to muscle on T2-weighted and short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) [9] primarily due to normal endoneural fluid [11].Motor neuropathy in gluteus medius and minimus can used to indirectly visualise SGN impingement [12]. In acute and subacute presentation, this will appear as high-intensity for denervated muscles on T2-weighted and STIR images, while appear as normal intensity on T1 weighted images [13]. The normal architecture and size of the muscle are still preserved, with no abnormalities of subjacent fascia. As the denervation progresses, intensity of the muscle on T1-weighted image will increase [9]. In chronically denervated muscles, atrophy and fatty replacement[14], manifests as non-specific increase in signal intensity on both T1 and fluid sensitive images, indicating irreversibility [9].Teaching point:SGN entrapment is a cause of hip pain which may be easily missed.

He was febrile up to 39. On physical examination, the only finding was a distended abdomen. He had a history of hypertension.","Plain abdominal radiography showed one air-fluid level, as well as tube-like branching lucencies in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). Abdominal ultrasound (US) revealed a distended gallbladder with a transversal diameter of 50mm, containing sludge and an 11mm calculus. The gallbladder wall was irregularly thickened, up to 6mm. Computerised tomography (CT) scan confirmed the ultrasound findings in the gallbladder, with additional signs of severe inflammation indicating gangrenous cholecystitis, with wall disruption with multiple mural gas inclusions, including one air-liquid level in the lumen. It was reported that the wall-lining was irregular towards the D2-part of the duodenum, together with the gas inclusions in the lumen of the common bile duct. In the IV-segment of the liver, 8-millimeter hypodense zones surrounding the gallbladder were present pointing to abscessing areas.","Presented radiological and clinical findings may suggest a few potential diagnoses. Pneumobilia is described as the occurrence of free air in the gallbladder or biliary tree. There are a number of causes of pneumobilia, including surgically created biliary enteric fistula, instrumentation of the bile duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, an incompetent sphincter of Oddi, internal biliary fistula (IBF), emphysematous cholecystitis (EC), pyogenic cholangitis [1, 2]. Gas in the biliary tree is an infrequent finding in EC [2]. The initial diagnosis for our patient, following the presented radiological and clinical findings, was a spontaneous IBF. These fistulas are formed between the extrahepatic biliary tract and a variety of adjacent organs [3]. Our main suspicion was a choledochoduodenal fistula. In the study performed by Yamashita et al [3], it was found that all the patients that were proven to have a choledochoduodenal fistula had had gallstones in the gallbladder, and 44% of patient with IBF showed signs of pneumobilia on CT. An internal biliary fistula was excluded in our patient in surgery with intraoperative cholangiography. A gangrenous gallbladder was found with an abscess on the posterior wall and a cholecystectomy was performed. The patohistology finding confirmed the acute ulcero-gangrenous cholecystitis on a ground of chronic fibrinous cholecystitis, together with sero-fibrinous pericholecystitis. EC is a rare and severe variant of acute cholecystitis, characterised by gas production in and around the gallbladder wall [4]. Gas forming organisms, most frequently Chlostridium welchi and Echerichia coli, have often been identified in patients with this condition. They are postulated to thrive in anaerobic atmosphere of devitalised tissue resulting from vascular insufficiency of the gallbladder wall in arteriopathic patients [5-6]. Welch and Flexner first described this entity in 1896 [7]. Hegner first described its associated radiologist signs in 1931. Its clinical definition is based on the presence of air in the gallbladder lumen, wall or tissues surrounding the wall, in the absence of abnormal communication with the gastrointestinal tract [4]. The diagnosis of emphysematous cholecystitis often requires imaging techniques. The radiological diagnosis is based on the detection of gas within the gallbladder (stage 1), the gallbladder wall (stage 2), which was the case with our patient or pericholecystitic tissue (stage 3). CT scan is considered to be the gold standard for the detection of emphysematous cholecystitis. However, due to the insidious onset of the clinical picture, the use of this technique is often delayed during the first few hours [4].

Case number 16686,2020/8/4,https://www.eurorad.org/case/16686,"Female patient, 81-year-old, admitted 4 days previously with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), on oxygen therapy and intravenous antibiotics. C-reactive protein (CRP) 229.5mg/L, without leukocytosis. Negative urine cultures. Blood culture withStreptococcus anginosus. An ENT consultation excluded oropharyngeal tract abnormalities. She progressed to septic shock with multiorganic dysfunction. A Computed Tomography (CT) was performed.","Abdominal and pelvic CT depicted a duodenal neoformative thickening (third portion) and parietal discontinuity, suggesting rupture, confirmed by a subsequent CT with oral contrast (Fig. 1). A fistulous tract, opacified by the oral contrast, lead to a paravertebral collection (L2-L4), with gas, measuring 70mm of maximum diameter, surrounding the infrarenal aorta (Fig. 2). We could also see the oral contrast extending to the intervertebral spaces and anterior epidural space/medullary canal. There were signs of previous vertebroplasty at L2-L3 (Fig. 3).Peri-pancreatic lymphadenopathy and?moderate free fluid were noted (Fig. 4).There was also an unremarkable bilateral pleural effusion and global cardiomegaly (Fig. 5). No parenchymal consolidations.The intraoperative appearance was compatible with the imaging findings, with a petrous neoformative mass in the duodenum, with a paravertebral abscess and fistulisation to the lumbar spine. Biopsy was not performed due to haemorrhagic risk. A gastrojejunostomy/duodenojejunostomy were performed. The patient died 10 days after surgery.","Spondylodiscitis refers to an infection of the intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies, with high morbidity and mortality. Immunosuppression, diabetes, alcoholism, drug addiction, recent surgical history and spinal trauma are the main risk factors. [1]The infection can reach the spine by multiple arteries (vertebral or lumbar arteries), veins (Batson venous plexus), by contiguity (secondary to an adjacent abscess) or direct inoculation (accidental or iatrogenic). [2]Blood cultures are essential but not sufficient in 50 to 75% of the cases and a biopsy is recommended. [1, 4]The most frequent pyogenic organisms involved areStaphylococcus aureus(60% of cases) andEnterobacter species(30%). [1]The Streptococcus anginosus(formerlyStreptococcus milleri), which was found on our patient＊s blood cultures, belongs to the anginosus group, that usually exist inside the paranasal sinuses, oropharynx, gastrointestinal and vaginal tract. [3]Due to this, we first excluded an ORL origin to the infection by an ENT. The following abdominopelvic CT revealed a neoformative duodenal mass with a fistulous tract to the intervertebral spaces as the cause of the spondylodiscitis and the haematogeneous infection.CT plays an important role in these cases, allowing evaluation of the intervertebral disc, and characterises epidural involvement (epiduritis/epidural abscess), which may lead to compression of the dural sac and nerve roots. [5] When accompanied by gas at the intervertebral spaces, iatrogenesis by recent interventions or a fistulous tract should be considered, as occurred in our case.Conventional radiography is insensitive for the first 2-4 weeks.MRI is the imaging of choice for evaluation, depicting inflammation of the vertebral endplates and peri-vertebral/epidural soft tissues, with focal hyperintensity of the intervertebral disc in T2-weighted image (WI), and a variable enhancement in T1-WI post-contrast.?Due to the rapidly progressive course, we were not able to perform an MRI in our patient.Treatment of choice is intravenous antibiotics accordingly to the pathogen sensitivity. Surgical intervention may be required (in cases secondary to other conditions).The follow-up depends on the clinical response: if good response, X-rays may suffice. MRI is required if a complication is suspected. Systematic MRI is not necessary (no correlation with the clinical improvement).[6]The radiologist plays an important role in making the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis and determining the source of infection, namely in rarer cases of abscess contiguity.Written informed patient consent for publication has been obtained.",Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforationPyogenic spondylodiscitis (Streptococcus anginosus) due to intestinal perforationIatrogenic spondylodiscitis (due to previous vertebroplasty)Tuberculous spondylodiscitisFungal spondylodiscitis,Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation,10,16686;16622;12133;10986;10096,"Area of InterestAbdomen,  Musculoskeletal spine,  Small bowel  ;Imaging TechniqueCTNo Procedure;Special FocusAbscess,  Infection;",title(final_diagnosis),580,Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation,"{""A"": ""Fungal spondylodiscitis"", ""B"": ""Iatrogenic spondylodiscitis (due to previous vertebroplasty)"", ""C"": ""Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation"", ""D"": ""Pyogenic spondylodiscitis (Streptococcus anginosus) due to intestinal perforation"", ""E"": ""Tuberculous spondylodiscitis""}",C,Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation,D,C,"[""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/ncFIV3lm.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/sMk6VIPh.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/6ASk8agW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/58zlA8Dc.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/LoJ8RZHU.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/5766QvMp.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/0fUthtqp.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/vQBziA-W.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/WjkbcPwN.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/wwpS_zsp.jpg""]","[""CT acquisition on the axial plane after intravenous contrast administration, depicting duodenal wall thickening and discontinuity (arrow), suggestive of a rupture."", ""CT acquisition on the axial plane complemented with oral contrast, confirms the intestinal rupture with oral contrast extravasation to the paravertebral abscess collection (arrow)."", ""CT acquisition after contrast administration on the axial plane, depicting the paravertebral abscess collection with endoluminal gas surrounding the aorta (arrows)."", ""CT reconstruction in the coronal plane depicting the collection with an infrarenal longitudinal extension along both sides of the aorta (arrows)."", ""CT reconstruction on the sagittal plane, depicting extension of the collection to the intervertebral spaces and anterior epidural space/medullary canal (arrows)."", ""CT reconstruction on the sagittal plane, after oral contrast administration, confirms the presence of a communication between the paravertebral collection and the intervertebral spaces (arrow)."", ""CT reconstruction on the sagittal plane, depicting coexisting changes compatible with previous L2 and L3 vertebroplasty (arrows)."", ""CT acquisition after contrast administration on the axial plane, depicting multiple peri-pancreatic adenopathies (arrow)."", ""CT reconstruction in the coronal plane, depicting multiple peri-pancreatic adenopathies (arrow) and a moderate amount of dispersed free fluid."", ""CT acquisition on the axial plane depicting mild bilateral pleural effusion, more pronounced at the right hemithorax, with passive bilateral lung atelectasis.

Case number 16720,2020/4/17,https://www.eurorad.org/case/16720,A 10-year-old girl with craniofacial malformation (cleft lip palate) and recurrent serous otitis media presented with persistent right hearing loss after multiple tympanostomy tube insertions. Otoscopy revealed aerated well-positioned long-term tubes. Audiologic evaluation was consistent with moderately-severe conductive hearing loss on the right ear with normal thresholds on the left.,"Unenhanced high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone revealed a bony place obliterating the oval window niche on the left, evident on both coronal and axial bone images, blocking the regular communication between the vestibule and the middle ear space and thus confirming the diagnosis of congenital oval window atresia (Fig. 1a). Right oval window was adequately fenestrated with in situ stapes footplate (Fig. 1b). Although we couldn＊t exclude left facial nerve canal dehiscence on its horizontal tympanic segment in some coronal cuts, it didn＊t show an inferior aberrant location that is frequently associated with oval window atresia. External auditory canal was patent, middle ear and mastoid cleft were aerated, the ossicles were normal and there was regular positioning of the incudomalleolar and incudostapedial articulations on both sides (Fig. 2a, b and 3a, b). Bilateral well-positioned and aerated Goode tympanostomy tubes were noted (Figure 4a, b). The remaining inner ear structures appeared normal.","Oval window atresia is an extremely rare congenital condition and its exact incidence is unknown. [1] It is characterised by the absence of an oval window in the presence of a bony plate superimposed between the vestibule and the middle ear cleft (Cremers class IVa anomaly). [2] It occurs bilaterally in 40% of patients. [3] Two embryologic theories have been suggested: failure of primitive stapes to fuse with the primitive vestibule and inferior displacement of the developing facial nerve, both precluding normal oval window development. [4]Patients are typically children presenting with non-progressive moderately-severe conductive hearing loss since birth (air-bone-gap>40dB). [1] Clinical information provided by the otolaryngologist, namely the characteristics of the hearing loss and otoscopic findings, can help the radiologist. Timely diagnosis of oval window atresia helps surgeons predict hearing outcomes for children under speech and language development and guide its management.CT scan is the best imaging technique to evaluate patients with suspected oval window atresia, aiding in both diagnosis and surgical planning. The usual rectangular shape of the oval window niche is obliterated with either a thick bone plate or concentric narrowing along the medial tympanic wall. There is an intimate relationship between the development of the oval window and that of the stapes footplate, horizontal segment of the facial nerve canal and vestibular portion of the otic capsule. In this perspective, associated classic imaging features include stapes absence or malformations (failure to identify both crura on axial CT images or stapes displacement from the oval window niche) and, less frequently, incus malformations. An abnormal more inferior course of the horizontal portion of the facial nerve, running over the oval window, commonly associated with dehiscence of its bony canal, is also frequently present. [1-4]Treatment options include conventional or bone-anchored hearing aids placement and, in selected cases, surgical correction. Operative techniques including vestibulotomy or oval window drilling with prosthesis placement are demanding and risky as there are few landmarks for the vestibule and the displaced exposed facial nerve is at risk for injury. [5]Take Home Message:Children presenting with maximal conductive hearing loss in the absence of other external and middle ear conditions or persistent irrespective of adequate acquired middle ear conditions treatment (e.g. tympanostomy tube insertion for recurrent otitis media with effusion), should be evaluated with a CT scan to exclude congenital malformations such as oval window atresia, mainly if other risk factors are present, such as craniofacial abnormalities.Written informed patient consent for publication has been obtained.",Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresiaCongenital epitympanic fixation of the incus and malleusCongenital stapes ankylosisOtosclerosisIncudostapedial defectSuperior semicircular canal dehiscence,Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia,8,18370;18314;18289;18270;18266;18206;18139;18138;18085;18003;17896;17882;17871;17736;17778;17765;17723;17705;17657;17655;17632;17645;17593;17591;17561;17554;17504;17503;17382;17333;17307;17262;17219;17163;17162;17110;17109;17108;17103;17084;17083;17003;16970;16776;16965;16936;16935;16881;16816;16791;16785;16743;16720;16713;16700;16683;16586;16573;16551;16534;16533;16530;16510;16439;16428;16415;16414;16408;16341;16292;16230;16283;16124;16159;16041;16070;16132;15932;15654;15679;15740;15556;15653;15507;15412;15574;15301;14984;15395;15265;15319;15405;15243;15320;15348;15194;15237;15090;15135;14999;15040;15164;14983;15024;15002;14934;14864;14903;14752;14594;14865;14664;14665;14304;14358;14456;14342;14399;14047;13873;14117;14128;14188;13890;13559;13517;13564;13608;13493;13283;13542;12980;13402;13229;13147;13176;13054;12955;12528;12719;12732;12576;12673;12603;12633;12595;12539;12557;12410;11941;12092;12333;12361;12015;11792;11922;11682;11800;11318;11347;11350;11219;10732;11059;11046;10867;11018;10926;10948;10793;10759;10772;10521;10455;10679;10417;10202;10385;10484;10317;10394;10297;10237;10229;9946;9971;9932;9782;9905;9518;9645;9528;9524;9319;9357;9015;9238,"Area of InterestEar / Nose / Throat,  Head and neck  ;Imaging TechniqueCTNo Procedure;No Special Focus;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,591,Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging,"{""A"": ""Congenital epitympanic fixation of the incus and malleus"", ""B"": ""Congenital stapes ankylosis"", ""C"": ""Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia"", ""D"": ""Superior semicircular canal dehiscence"", ""E"": ""Otosclerosis""}",C,Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia,A,C,"[""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/QLuNYaYb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/3EqiwoMB.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/G33iiFQp.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/BDglQwG2.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/UUa6dpbJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/AoACmTgD.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/JZ2c5KvB.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Isolated unilateral congenital oval window atresia presenting as persistent conductive hearing loss: Diagnostic imaging/KlqKNxUH.jpg""]","[""Coronal Temporal Bone CT (Left).

Case number 16760,2020/5/28,https://www.eurorad.org/case/16760,"60-year old female patient, non-smoker, was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology with left parotid gland tumour. The lesion was incidentally found during thyroid ultrasound (surveillance due to hypothyroidism). The patient was asymptomatic.","The lesion was reported on ultrasound as solid, hypoechoic and hypervascular. Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAC) was inconclusive due to the scarce amount of acquired material, however, no signs of atypia were found. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was thus requested by the referring physician. The examination confirmed the presence of an ovoid, well-marginated lesion in the deep lobe of the left parotid gland, measuring 8x11x16mm. The tumour was heterogeneous, predominantly hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1-WI), hyperintense on T2-WI and fat-saturated T2-WI (Figs. 1a-c). Signs of restriction of diffusion were present with Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) value of1.0x10-3mm2/sec(Figs. 2a,b). Lesion enhanced vividly and on the basis of dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence type""b§Time-intensity Curve (TiC) was obtained (Fig. 3). No signs of facial nerve involvement or perineurial spread were noted. Regional lymph nodes were not enlarged.","Imaging findings combined with anamnesis and physical examination seemed to be indicative of a Warthin Tumor. The patient was scheduled for elective parotidectomy - superficial lobe of the gland and a solitary nodule within the deep lobe was removed, the function of the facial nerve was preserved. However, the postoperative histopathological report brought an unexpected diagnosis of salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) with a prominent lymphoid infiltrate of the stroma. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second surgery in order to obtain wide margins and radiation. Post-operative second look evaluation of MRI did not differ from the first impression.AciCC is a slowly-growing, 3rd most frequent primary parotid malignancy with a prevalence in women [1]. It may be multicentric and bilateral. The prognosis is generally favourable (80%10-yr survival), however, local recurrence may be seen in up to 35% and distant metastases can be found in lungs and bones [1].Differentiation between malignant and benign lesions is of the utmost importance in reference to treatment planning. Local excision or superficial parotidectomy is usually sufficient in benign lesions, total parotidectomy with risk of injury to the facial nerve is required in malignancy [2]. Clinical findings often show limited value with a few indicators of malignancy (e.g. facial nerve palsy). FNAC is inconclusive in up to 5% of the cases [3-6]. MRI is well established in detecting parotid gland tumours. The analysis of conventional sequences with DWI and DCE-MRI allows to differentiate various types of parotid tumours [7,8,9] with increasing diagnostic accuracy, however, some of the features may overlap between histologies. Radiological signs of malignancy include indistinct margins, involvement of nerves and/or lymphadenopathy. The well-defined lesion is usually benign. Analysis of DCE-MRI is based on an assessment of time-signal intensity curves obtained by placing regions of interest (ROIs) over the lesion [8,9,10] - Fig. 4. Estimationof ADC thresholds derived from the receiver operating characteristic curves remains a subject to research [8,11,12,13]. Yabuuchi et al. suggested thresholds of 1.4x10-3mm2/secto differentiate pleomorphic adenomas from carcinomas and 1.0x10-3mm2/secbetween Warthin Tumors and carcinomas [11].Take-home messages:1. Multiparametric MRI is an important examination in the assessment of parotid gland masses.2. Radiologists should be aware that certain features may overlap across various histologies, particularly in case of Warthin Tumors and malignancies.3.

Case number 17337,2021/6/30,https://www.eurorad.org/case/17337,"A 23-year-old woman was admitted in our hospital referring abdominal pain. She had an acute pancreatitis in childhood and has recently been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome and a body mass index of 26.","A contrast-enhanced CT scan shows uniformly low attenuation of the pancreatic body and tail, which has the same attenuation as the surrounding fatty tissue. It associates mass effect on adjacent structures, displacing the duodenum and the stomach anteriorly.MRI demonstrates the absence of the pancreatic body and tail with high-intensity signal on T1-weighted images (WI) and T2-WI and signal intensity loss on fat tissue suppression sequences, which indicates fatty replacement.","Lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas is an unusual and benign condition, the pancreas is markedly enlarged secondary to localized or diffuse replacement of pancreatic acinar cells with mature adipose tissue. [1-4]A diffuse involvement of the pancreas is more frequent (70%) and it is less common a localized replacement in the pancreas head (20%) and in the body and tail (10%). [3]Although the aetiology of this entity is unknown, there are some theories that consider a viral infection or abnormal metabolism. Moreover, many authors include it in the spectrum of pancreatic lipomatosis. It can affect a broad age range and there is no sex predominance. [1, 2, 4]Lipomatous pseudohypertrophy is associated to cystic fibrosis, Schwachman-Bodia-Diamond syndrome, Bannayan syndrome and Johanson-Blizzard syndrome; and it is correlated directly with obesity, diabetes mellitus and chronic pancreatitis. [3, 4]It is frequently asymptomatic and it is discovered incidentally. However, when it presents symptoms, the principal ones are abdominal pain, indigestion and steatorrhea (exocrine insufficiency). Sometimes it can produce jaundice, secondary to mass effect on the bile duct. [1, 5]The diagnosis is made with the following features: pancreatic enlargement due to the replacement with mature adipose tissue, almost complete absence of the pancreatic exocrine function and preserved ductal system and Langerhans islets. These characteristics can be confirmed with imaging techniques. [1, 5]On CT scan pancreatic parenchyma has a low attenuation, the same attenuation as the surrounding fatty tissue, and it maintains the shape. Furthermore, there can be mass effect on adjacent structures. On MRI, the pancreas demonstrates signal intensity loss on opposed-phase images when compared with in-phase images. [1, 3]Some authors consider the secretin-stimulated MR cholangiopancreatography to be the technique of choice because it allows to obtain morphologic and functional information of the ductal system and to evaluate the exocrine function. [5]Patients with lipomatous pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas should be tracked periodically and in some cases, digestive enzymes are prescribed, due to the pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.

Case number 17406,2021/9/23,https://www.eurorad.org/case/17406,"A 59 year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of dyspnea and fatigue after two episodes of alimentary vomits. Past medical history included epiglottis cancer, hepatitis B, COVID-19 and pulmonary tuberculosis. Physical examination revealed signs of mild dehydration. Blood tests revealed leucocitosis (12300 cells/mm3) and C-Reactive protein of 11.19 mg/L. She was admitted with a presumed diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis complicated with dehydration, oral intolerance and acute renal failure and initiated empiric antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin).","Chest X-ray revealed small nodular opacities bilaterally, probable tuberculous granulomas. Abdominal ultrasound showed signs of chronic hepatopathy and a thin left peri-renal fluid layer.On day 2 of admission with a presumed diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis she showed signs of respiratory distress and abdominal distention. Repeated chest X-ray (Fig. 1) revealed massive pneumoperitoneum. Abdominal X-ray (Fig. 2) showed a gas-fluid level, also shown on ultrasound as intra-abdominal gas centrally and moderate volume of peritoneal fluid.Subsequent computer tomography (CT) detected a large pneumoperitoneum and a moderate quantity of free fluid (Figs. 3,4). A small discontinuity in the anterior aspect of the duodenal bulb and adjacent wall thickening and edema were found, highly suggestive of duodenal perforation.Urgent surgical intervention confirmed a perforated justapyloric ulcer measuring 1,5 cm in the first portion of duodenum with ischemic borders. A pyloroplasty and peritoneal lavage were done. Afterwards, she developed signs of septic chock and ischemic hepatitis and despite optimal supportive and therapeutic measures she passed away at day 3 of admission.","Most cases of pneumoperitoneum are secondary to gastric/duodenal ulcer perforation, a life-threatening complication with 10-40% mortality rate. Perforation may also be secondary to bowel obstruction, inflammatory or neoplasic conditions, ischemic bowel, trauma or iatrogenic. Immediate postoperative status, peritoneal dialysis, gas-forming bacterial infection and mechanical ventilation are other causes of pneumoperitoneum and it may be an isolated asymptomatic finding. [1-5]Clinical presentation of peptic ulcer perforation is variable and dependent on factors such as the time since perforation, its size and extent of gastroduodenal contents extravasation. Most commonly patients show clinical signs of peritonitis, although symptoms may be mild or absent in older or immunocompromised patients. [5]Tension pneumoperitoneum occurs when gas compression results in decreased venous return and cardiac output. [6] Differential diagnosis include other causes of acute abdomen such as acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or appendicitis. [5]Free abdominal air is most commonly detected in upright chest x-rays as subdiaphragmatic crescent air densities.Specific signs in supine abdominal x-ray include linear subhepatic collection of air, gas outlining the falciform ligament and the Rigler sign (air on both sides of bowel wall).When fluid is also present, an abdominal air-fluid level in seen. [1,2,4]CT is valuable in cases of small amounts of air and may reveal its cause and location (specially if oral contrast is given) and additional findingssuch as free fluid, fluid collections, inflammatory signs and gastric or duodenal wall thickening. [6]A large amount of intraperitoneal air suggests gastroduodenal perforation or bowel perforation secondary to obstruction or endoscopic procedures. Perforations in retroperitoneal portions of duodenum (descending and horizontal) manifest as pneumoretroperitoneum, which spreads less freely than intraperitoneal gas. [7] The absence of retroperitoneal air in our patient was consistent with the site of perforation, demonstrating the usefulness of the extraluminal air distribution on CT in locating gastrointestinal perforations.Ultrasonography isn＊t usually chosen given that gas is a reflector that hinders the transmission of ultrasound, although it can detect free fluid, inflammatory masses, fluid collections, extraluminal gas bubbles close to the perforation site and other signs of perforation (gas bubbles extending beyond wall＊s contour and sometimes a cleft or defect on the outer surface outlined by fluid). [3,5,6]Urgent surgical intervention is mandatory in most cases of peptic ulcer perforation. [3] Few cases may be treated conservatively, including those asymptomatic, contained or diagnosed within 8 hours.

Case number 17930,2022/11/29,https://www.eurorad.org/case/17930,A 53-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department because of a 24-hour history of right flank pain.No fever or vomiting was described. Abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with positive Blumberg sign.The only laboratory abnormality was a mild elevation of C Reactive Protein.,"Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an enlarged appendix (2 cm diameter, short axis) with irregular wall thickening and diffuse stranding of the adjacent mesenteric fat.Mild ascites in the right paracolic gutter and 2-3 small pericecallymph nodeswere also noted.No pneumoperitoneum or other small bowel or colonic abnormality were seen.","The patient was submitted to an appendicectomy with symptomatic resolution. The macroscopic features of the appendix were also consistent with an acute appendicitis, according to the surgeons. However, ??the final histopathological diagnosis,apart from inflammatory findings,was well-differentiated nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendixstage III (pT3 pN1a).Appendiceal neoplasms are uncommon tumours found in approximately 1% of appendicectomy specimens. Approximately 30%每50% of these tumours will manifest acutely mimicking a typical appendicitis [1].Sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is generally above 90% in most published series, and CT is now commonly performed especially in adult patients and atypical presentations. Preoperative detection of appendiceal neoplasms is important because it may result in change not only in the surgical approach (ie, laparoscopic vs open surgery) but also in the appropriate procedure (ie, appendectomy vs right hemicolectomy) [2].Red flags on CT that help in differentiating underlying appendiceal neoplasm from appendicitis are: appendiceal diameter of >15mm, associated soft-tissue mass, wall-thickening and irregularity [3].The majority of appendiceal masses consist of primary epithelial neoplasms, being the epithelial adenocarcinoma the most common malignant neoplasm of the appendix, with mucinous and nonmucinous histologic types occurring in 37% and 27% of cases, respectively [4].In our case the histopathological diagnosis was nonmucinous (colonic-type) adenocarcinoma of the appendix.Characteristic imaging features of these neoplasms include a focal soft-tissue mass or subtle soft-tissue infiltration of the entire appendix, without mucocele formation. Periappendiceal fat stranding is common and may be due to extension of the primary tumour and/or superimposed appendicitis. Cross-sectional evaluation usually demonstrates direct invasion of the adjacent organs, regional and distant lymphadenopathy, and metastatic disease [2].Right hemicolectomy is considered the standard of care, and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy is also indicated in node-positive disease [5],as happened in our case: a right hemicolectomy was eventually performed, and treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabin was initiated.Patients should undergo colonoscopy to evaluate for synchronous colorectal tumours. Alsoto assess whether the tumour displays the characteristic molecular features of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, the expression of mismatch-repair (MMR) proteins and microsatellite instability (MSI) status must be investigated [6]. Our patient presented loss of MSH2/MSH6 expression.Teaching points:Imaging findings may overlap with those of acute appendicitis.Features that should alert the radiologist to the presence of an underlying neoplasm arediameter of >15mm,irregular wall thickening of the appendix, enhancing soft-tissue nodularity, infiltration, or a mass.Written informed patient consent for publication has been obtained.",Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendixAppendicitisMucocele of the appendixCaecal diverticulitisAppendiceal tumour,Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix,5,18374;18338;18330;18136;18135;18084;18024;18017;17967;17958;17932;17930;17941;17891;17730;17714;17687;17556;17528;17501;17478;17406;17374;17336;17310;17265;17167;17151;17150;17148;17058;17044;17034;17033;17014;16863;16860;16818;16817;16803;16748;16652;16572;16539;16516;16458;16446;16445;16418;16400;16362;16290;16160;16239;16166;15991;15983;15806;15860;15502;15782;15684;15734;15692;15660;15086;15580;15388;15420;15295;15227;15234;15034;15104;14970;14947;14606;14878;14714;14495;14426;14086;14321;14152;14308;13937;13943;14150;14189;14131;14154;14087;14064;13885;13661;13962;13936;13938;13784;13757;13756;13660;13676;13253;13509;13518;13535;13523;13334;13453;13354;13321;13378;13312;13314;13268;13180;12960;13067;12679;13042;12855;12970;12994;13003;12913;12876;12815;12782;12669;12710;12591;12642;12483;12402;11091;12256;12277;12199;12297;12115;12024;12051;11987;11431;11975;11885;11448;11741;11591;11713;11665;11490;11495;11597;11498;11557;11543;11533;11458;11456;11445;11466;11409;11298;10993;11268;11248;11096;11198;11050;11159;11172;11145;11027;10998;10945;11001;10960;10781;10975;10804;10934;10825;10807;10713;10740;10843;10816;10789;10405;10746;10472;10644;10669;10629;10596;10587;10485;10479;10468;10217;10446;10397;10324;10400;10338;10310;10258;10211;10209;10073;9921;10152;10038;10051;10028;9728;9966;9841;9976;9929;9822;9800;9832;9729;8966;9621;9555;9537;9516;9453;9403;9176;9291;9300;9116;9088;9029;8899,"Area of InterestAbdomen,  Gastrointestinal tract,  Oncology  ;Imaging TechniqueCTNo Procedure;Special FocusAcute,  Cancer,  Neoplasia;",clinical_history,648,Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis,"{""A"": ""Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix"", ""B"": ""Appendiceal tumour"", ""C"": ""Caecal diverticulitis"", ""D"": ""Mucocele of the appendix"", ""E"": ""Appendicitis""}",A,Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix,C,A,"[""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/a4UheKSt.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/QAU2brxb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/v_MOnD7F.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/3TA78fqs.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/FTwGhb_4.jpg""]","[""Contrast-enhanced transverse CT scan shows irregular circumferential wall thickening and dilatation of the appendix (red arrow: maximal appendiceal diameter 2 cm) arrow.

Case number 9232,2011/6/19,https://www.eurorad.org/case/9232,"2-year-old patient came to our attention for acute right-leg pain, palpable muscle thickening and walking impairment due to painful leg press-up referred after a mild effort.There was no significant clinical history.","On admission, plain film revealed cortical bone sclerosis of right femoral diaphysis (Fig.1). Ultrasound showed an inhomogeneous mass, 8x3 cm on maximum diameter, placed into the deep muscle-layer of the thigh (Fig.2a,b). Lesion appeared well defined, quite squeezable using the US-convex probe with clear colour Doppler signals (Fig.2c,d). MR examination was performed: lesion appeared isointense in SE T1W images (Fig.3a), inhomogeneously hyperintense on STIR sequences (Fig.3b,c) with multiple signal-void areas on FFE T2W sequences (Fig.3d), after paramagnetic cm iv-administration a significant inhomogeneous enhancement was also achieved. Moreover, the involved muscle appeared replaced by the lesion rather than really compressed (Fig.3e,f). CT examination showed the diffuse cortical bone thickening better without any appreciable cortical breaks (Fig.4).Based on these findings, differential diagnosis of mesenchimal sarcoma could not be excluded, for this reason surgical biopsy was performed. Finally, artero-venous malformation was confirmed on histologic evaluation (Fig.5).","The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification, based on cellular features, subdivides vascular anomalies in vascular tumours and vascular malformations (simple or combined). Jackson et al classify haemangiomas, vascular malformations, and lymphatic malformations on the basis of vascular dynamics. Malformations with arterial components are considered high-flow lesions and those without arterial components are considered low-flow lesions.US is an essential, noninvasive tool used to examine superficial vascular lesions. Colour Doppler imaging permits analysis of arterial and venous flow and measurement of flow velocities, it also results in an important method for monitoring patients who have undergone therapy, but it is limited in the assessment of deep lesions and lesions adjacent to interfering air or bone.CT with iv cm-administration is useful for assessment of vascular malformations; to estimate the presence of calcification or thrombus, distal runoff (when lesions are located in the extremities) and concomitant lesions. Because CT involves considerable exposure to ionising radiation and provides less information about blood flow, MR imaging has replaced CT in the evaluation of vascular malformations.MR imaging is the most valuable modality for the classification of vascular malformations. It depicts the anatomic relations between the vascular lesion and adjacent organs. Slow-flow venous malformations have high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas high-flow arteriovenous malformations and fistulas contain a signal void. Phleboliths and calcifications also show signal voids in all image sequences. Dynamic study with a gradient pulse sequence is useful for evaluating the flow velocity (slow, intermediate, or high) of lesions and in monitoring patients who have undergone therapy.",High-flow venous malformation of the right thighHaemangioma / other high-flow vascular malformationsLow-flow vascular malformationsFibrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcomaHaemangioendothelioma / angiosarcomaEwing\'s Sarcoma,High-flow venous malformation of the right thigh,14,15459;15366;14915;14500;13683;13516;13073;13058;12678;12652;12583;12210;11408;10533;9942;9232,"Area of InterestMusculoskeletal soft tissue,  Extremities,  Musculoskeletal bone  ;Imaging TechniqueDigital radiography,  Ultrasound,  Ultrasound-Colour Doppler,  MR,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure,  Computer Applications-Detection, diagnosis,  Biopsy;No Special Focus;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,705,Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation,"{""A"": ""Haemangioma / other high-flow vascular malformations"", ""B"": ""Low-flow vascular malformations"", ""C"": ""Fibrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma"", ""D"": ""Ewing\\'s Sarcoma"", ""E"": ""High-flow venous malformation of the right thigh""}",E,High-flow venous malformation of the right thigh,B,E,"[""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/AyQ5ZO76.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/8PEqhOwd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/QflBuFg7.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/8OpB2Pz5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/o8B7qjj1.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/X8u7goYM.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/QAzaMjlR.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/fQ8qh-Xg.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/Xt3nP9Cz.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/1A4M4YL7.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/as6bLr8B.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/gao3v05G.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/WQyQT0Ql.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/qb68gr8P.jpg""]","[""Longitudinal scan: picture shows an hypoechoic and well defined mass, along the deep muscle layers, closed to the proximal femoral diaphysis."", ""Axial scan showing the hypoechoic mass anteriorly to the femoral bone."", ""Long-axis scan: colour Doppler scan shows a significant intralesional vascular flow, with multiple vascular-sinues filling aspect\n(signal has been acquired using high-flow vascular presetting)."", ""Axial colour Doppler scan confirms the same findings."", ""Microscopic findings: photo well defines the arterovenous anomalous channels - with some blood-clots inside the lumen - surrounded by lipidic and muscle tissue."", ""SE T1W sequence: picture shows the isointesity lesion (when compared to adjacent muscle signal), scattered by irregular hyperintensity signal spots."", ""Axial STIR sequence:  inhomogeneous aspect of the lesion with widely hypointense areas surrounded by high-signal intensity tissue."", ""Coronal STIR sequence also shows the hypointensity cortical bone thickening (due to sclerosis by compressive effect of surrounding lesion) and hyperintensity signal by bone-marrow oedema."", ""After iv cm-administration, axial SPIR T1W sequence.

Extraluminal gas bubbles are also seen (pneumoperitoneum). Between the duodenum and right colon a tubular hypodense image can be observed, that could correspond to a fistulous tract.On the surgery a 3cm lesion was found on the antimesenteric border of duodenum with intraluminal growth and border bleeding.The hysthologic result showed: inflammatory granulomatous reaction in the duodenal lesion and extirpated adenopathies, necrotic areas in some adenopathies and flat ulcerations surrounded by granulomatous lesions at the duodenal mucosa. The findings were compatible with tuberculous etiology.After surgery the patient was treated with antituberculous drugs and controlled at the Department of Infectious Disease.","Intestinal TB may present as an inflammatory stricture, hypertrophic lesions resembling polyps or tumours, segmental ulcers and colitis.After the bacillus enters the gastrointestinal tract, it traverses the mucosa and lodges in the submucosa where it induces inflammatory changes that can lead to lymphangitis, endarteritis and fibrosis which can progress to mucosal ulceration, caseating necrosis and narrowing of the intestinal lumen. Diagnosing abdominal TB is difficult because its presenting signs, symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are non-specific and non-diagnostic.Symptoms of abdominal TB include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, anorexia, weight loss, constipation and haemorrhage [2].The most frequent symptom at presentation (in 90每100% patients) is abdominal colicky pain representing intermittent bowel obstruction. Massive haemorrhage necessitating blood transfusion is very uncommon in gastrointestinal tuberculosis. Indeed, few cases have been reported worldwide. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is reported to be difficult to diagnose, because its symptoms are varied and sometimes overlap with a broad range of other abdominal ailments, such as colorectal cancer, Crohn＊s disease, ulcerative colitis, colonic lymphoma, amoebic colitis, periappendicular abscess and diverticulitis and it can be located in any region of the gastrointestinal tract, complicating the location of infected areas [3].Chest radiographs are positive in only 20每50% of patients with intestinal TB.CT and abdominal ultrasound findings suggestive of abdominal TB include ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, omental thickening and bowel-wall thickening. Definitive diagnosis is based on histology, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli and culture [1].Colonoscopy with biopsy is the most useful non-operative diagnostic test for intestinal TB (identification of granulomatous lesions accompanied by necrosis and lymphangitis by biopsy) [2].The management of abdominal TB relies on TB drugs; surgery is reserved for complications and uncertainty of diagnosis.Intestinal TB may mimic other abdominal diseases, such as Crohn＊s disease. Differentiating TB from Crohn＊s disease is important, since treatment of these two disorders is very different. Both entities may present with mucosal ulcerations, nodularity, ulcers, pseudopolyps, luminal narrowing and strictures.A timely diagnosis and initiation of therapy may prevent complications and improve outcomes [4].It is imperative to consider gastrointestinal tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of massive gastrointestinal bleeding.",Intestinal TBCrohn\'s diseaseDuodenal abscessIntestinal TBDuodenal neoplasia,Intestinal TB,6,9246;9407;9429;9467;9489;9455;9449;9439;9316;9404;9083;9431;9411;9380;9325;9366;9134;9102;9045;8938,Area of InterestAbdomen  ;No Imaging TechniqueNo Procedure;No Special Focus;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,707,"Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding","{""A"": ""Intestinal TB"", ""B"": ""Crohn\\'s disease"", ""C"": ""Intestinal TB"", ""D"": ""Duodenal abscess"", ""E"": ""Duodenal neoplasia""}",A,Intestinal TB,B,A,"[""EURORAD/Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding/c4ArpvxA.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding/eK2aUEZI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding/G40GPAns.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding/A1uLaGb2.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding/9Su1g2gf.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Tuberculosis, a possible cause of intestinal bleeding/Ol9NJ3IW.jpg""]","[""Mesenteric calcified adenopathy (arrow)."", ""Mesenteric calcified adenopathy (arrow)."", ""Contrast extravasation (arrow) and extraluminal gas (arrowhead)."", ""Hypodense duodenal lesion (narrow arrow), extraluminal gas (arrowhead) and contrast extravasation (wide arrow)."", ""Hypodense duodenal lesion (wide arrow), extraluminal gas (arrowhead) and contrast extravasation(narrow arrow)."", ""Inflammatory changes in the mesentery fat and a tubular hypodense image between the duodenum and right colon, that could correspond to a fistulous tract (arrow).""]"

Emergency CT examination yielded diffuse concentric wall thickening of the caecum,ascending colon and hepatic flexure showing the target sign consistent with mural oedema and inflammation. The terminal ileum was spared from pathologic changes. Associated findings included moderately ascites and inflammatory stranding of the right pericolonic fat. Significant adenopathies,  focal liver or spleen lesions were not detected.Microscopy and cultures on stools and blood were negative for bacteria (particularly Shigella and Clostridium difficile),mycobacteria,fungi and toxins. Positive serum antibodies for Entamoeba allowed a clinical diagnosis of amoebic colitis and antibiotic treatment was prescribed.After 3 months,follow-up CT disclosed disappearance of both ascites and mural colonic abnormalities,thus confirming the clinical diagnosis.","Amoebiasis,  defined by the WHO as infection by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica regardless of symptoms,  is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food or water. It is endemic in countries with poor socio-economic and sanitary conditions. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic and harbour the non-pathogen variant Entamoeba dispar, whereas 4-10% develop invasive disease including colitis or liver abscess. In developed countries,  high-risk groups include travellers,  immigrants and HIV-infected people.Pathologically,  amebic colitis is characterised by intestinal wall invasion by trophozoites. Clinical presentation varies from mild,  often intermittent episodes of watery or blood-tinged diarrhoea,  to severe dysentery with fever,  abdominal pain,  weight loss,  and fulminant acute abdomen.Endoscopic findings range from sparse ulcerations to diffuse mucosal abnormalities, sometimes mimicking those observed in chronic inflammatory diseases. Diagnosis is obtained by the detection of trophozoites in the stools,  by colonic biopsies,  or with serological tests.Amebiasis can be cured successfully by administration of metronidazole; surgical resection is necessary for rare necrotizing forms.Opportunistic intestinal infections constitute a large source of morbidity in HIV patients. CT is the mainstay modality to image patients with suspected inflammatory conditions of the bowel in both elective and emergency conditions. Infectious colitides exhibit variable-degree wall thickening,often with the target sign consisting in concentric rings of different attenuation corresponding to mucosal hyperemia and  submucosal oedema. This mural stratification is more pronounced when arterial phase images are acquired. It indicates acute non-malignant bowel injury from inflammatory,infectious or ischemic disease and virtually excludes malignancy. Ascites and pericolonic fat inflammatory stranding may be associated.Considerable overlap exists between the imaging appearance of infectious colitides,  usually diagnosed clinically using stool cultures,  and laboratory and colonoscopy findings. Amebic colitis commonly occurs in the right colon or rectum and characteristically spares the ileum. In HIV-patients, Cytomegalovirus enteritis involves a variable colonic length usually on the right side,  and often the terminal ileum too. Pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile overgrowth appears as a pancolitis. Other differential diagnoses include ischemic colitis, tuberculosis,  neutropenic thyphlitis and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases,  the latter uncommonly associated with ascites.Amebic colitis should be always kept in mind as a frequent cause of dysentery or other intestinal complaints in AIDS patients,  particularly homosexual men. CT may suggest the diagnosis even in patient imaged for different reasons,  and identify complications such as liver or lung abscess,  ascites,  megacolon and perforation.",Amoebic colitisCytomegalovirus (CMV) colitisBacterial colitis (ShigellaSalmonellaYersinia＃)Pseudomembranous (Cl. difficile) colitisTyphlitisTuberculosisUlcerative colitisCrohn＊s diseaseIschaemic colitis,Amoebic colitis,12,9299,Area of InterestColon  ;Imaging TechniqueCTNo Procedure;Special FocusAIDS;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,712,Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient,"{""A"": ""Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis"", ""B"": ""Crohn＊s disease"", ""C"": ""Amoebic colitis"", ""D"": ""Typhlitis"", ""E"": ""Ulcerative colitis""}",C,Amoebic colitis,A,C,"[""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/oW8aPECC.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/hVmuxpTx.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/AMiu1lLH.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/xxKWYmyz.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/UWFQ7Tan.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/BTAGvSA5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/X-grcg4x.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/R972mdB_.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/-esaWU_d.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/uSy5zElV.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/rOcZhJ4_.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Amoebic colitis in an HIV-infected patient/4MKNsZ8C.jpg""]","[""Unenhanced (a) and portal venous phase (b) images show moderate perihepatic and perisplenic ascites.

Case number 9435,2011/7/8,https://www.eurorad.org/case/9435,"An 11-year-old boy who lived on a farm presented with a 2-week history of fever, vomiting and pain in the right hip that extended into the right buttock. The patient was non-weight bearing on the right leg, with restricted movement of the right hip. CRP was elevated.","The pelvic radiograph (Fig. 1) at presentation was normal. Clinical examination had revealed tenderness on deep palpation of the right iliac fossa, and an abdominal ultrasound obtained to exclude appendicitis was negative. No hip joint effusion was seen on ultrasound. A MRI examination (Fig. 2) was requested. Axial and coronal STIR and T2w images showed a focal lesion with surrounding high signal in the right sacral alum and less well-defined high signal in the right iliac bone also. The sacral lesion was associated with cortical loss at the inferior aspect of the right sacroiliac joint and a low signal (all sequences) central bony sequestrum. The adjacent iliacus, pectineus, obturator internus, psoas and gluteus maximus muscles were thickened and of high signal. There was marked enhancement post-gadolinium of the bony sacral lesion and the anterior soft tissue collection. A subsequent limited-range CT examination (Fig. 3) showed the sacral abnormalities in more detail.","The patient was commenced on IV antibiotics, which are to continue for 12-weeks. The orthopaedic team opted to treat empirically rather than perform a biopsy, as following the CT examination, it was deemed un-necessarily difficult to safely biopsy the sacrum. Within 48 hours, the patient＊s symptoms had lessened and his inflammatory markers had decreased.The annual incidence of septic arthritis is 5.2 每 12/100 000 and pyogenic sacroiliitis accounts for 1-2% of cases [1]. Sacral osteomyelitis is rare and diagnosis is often delayed due to a variable clinical presentation, low suspicion of examining clinician, lack of awareness of diagnostic procedure, and rare findings on plain radiographs. The rate of complications increases with delay in diagnosis, and includes abscess or sequestrum formation, prolonged period of sepsis, long-term joint deformity, disability or even death [2].Presentation is often a triad of fever, low back pain and difficulty weight-bearing, associated with an elevated C-reactive protein. The most common causative agent is Staphlococcus aureus, and a study by Wu et al 2007 [2] found positive blood cultures in 80% of paediatric patients, with a high rate of synovial aspirate culture. One in three patients in this study had a concurrent infection, with the urinary tract the most common site. Brucellosis and other atypical organisms are associated with sacral osteomyelitis.The plain radiograph is rarely helpful. An ultrasound examination is useful to exclude a hip joint effusion. Tc99-MDP bone scan is a sensitive test, but lacks specificity. CT clearly shows bone and soft tissue involvement, and may have a role in aspiration or biopsy. MRI has emerged as the imaging modality of choice due to its increased sensitivity and specificity [3, 4]. MRI is sensitive for bone marrow change but there is debate in the literature as to whether osteomyelitis can be differentiated from sacroiliitis [5]. It has been suggested that the presence of subperiosteal infiltrates or transcapsular infiltration of the juxta-articular muscle layers is a specific finding of sacroiliitis due to a septic osteomyelitis rather than spondyloarthropathy [3].Crohn's disease is associated with musculoskeletal complications with psoas and gluteal muscle abscesses, abdominal wall fistulae and sacral osteomyelitis, all described [6]. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis is an inflammatory form of osteomyelitis, and although it is rare and the sacrum an uncommon site, it is a condition to be considered in adolescent patients presenting with osteomyelitis, in order to prevent prolonged ineffective antibiotic therapy and inappropriate surgery [7].",Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis.Pyogenic osteomyelitis - Staphylococcus aureusBrucellosisTB and other atypical organismsInflammatory causes - Inflammatory bowel diseaseChronic recurrent multi-focal osteomyelitis and systemic sclerosisIatrogenic causes - recent instrumentation or surgery to the back or spineGenitourinary tract or abdomen and pelvisSickle cell disease,Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis.,7,9435,"Area of InterestPelvis  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  MRNo Procedure;Special FocusInfection;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,720,Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis,"{""A"": ""Brucellosis"", ""B"": ""Pyogenic osteomyelitis - Staphylococcus aureus"", ""C"": ""Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis."", ""D"": ""Genitourinary tract or abdomen and pelvis"", ""E"": ""Sickle cell disease""}",C,Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis.,B,C,"[""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/J1Qxu-tO.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/PzTyQsRJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/R6WYhjWw.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/a-Cfsgnb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/JJypxfcY.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/uNULj4MN.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/PWuPP3QU.jpg""]","[""AP radiograph of the pelvis.

Case number 9556,2012/1/18,https://www.eurorad.org/case/9556,A 5-year-old boy with no relevant personal or family medical history was admitted at the emergency department with dysuria and hypogastric pain with 24 hours of evolution. On physical examination a hard painful mass in the right flank and right iliac fossa was noted and therefore the patient underwent abdominal ultrasound and CT.,"Abdominal sonography demonstrated a solid heterogeneous well-defined mass, without calcification, with small cystic areas, located above the bladder.Abdominal CT showed a large lobulated, soft tissue density mass in the pelvic region. The mass was heterogeneous, with extensive hypodense areas reflecting necrosis. No evidence of calcification was seen in the lesion. The mass extended from the aortic bifurcation making contact with the bladder, but without definite signs of invasion. There were no signs of bone invasion. Both kidneys were normal.The following complementary exams were performed: Tru-cut biopsy (inconclusive), tumour markers - alpha-fetoprotein, beta-HCG - and urinary catecholamines (normal), bone scintigraphy (normal) and myelogram (normal).Since the results were inconclusive the child underwent surgical biopsy and the diagnosis of extrarenal nephroblastoma was established.Surgical resection, chemotherapy and neoadjuvant radiotherapy were performed.","Wilms' tumour (also referred to as nephroblastoma) is the most common genitourinary tract tumour in children. It is an embryonic malignant tumour composed of varying amounts of kidney embryonic elements [1, 2].Its extrarenal location is extremely rare and poorly understood. So far only a few isolated cases were described in literature [3, 4].It can occur in various locations and clinical presentation is nonspecific and dependent on the tumour location. It is almost always difficult to diagnose it preoperatively.Most cases have occurred in the retroperitoneum and inguinal canal. It can also affect uterus, cervix, testis, epididymis, skin and even the thorax. Renal Wilms' tumour generally occurs before the age of 10. Likewise, most extrarenal cases also occur in young patients [3-5].The diagnosis of extrarenal Wilms' tumour excludes, by definition, a primary tumour of the kidney. Therefore it is important to exclude a primary tumour of the kidney with extrarenal metastases or the presence of a supernumerary kidney. However, the final diagnosis is established by histopathology [4-8].The intrarenal Wilms' tumour originates from metanephric blastema, but its extrarenal origin is much more controversial. Most advocate a similar origin to the intrarenal tumour occurring in heterotopic foci of metanephric blastema, others argue a mesonephric origin, and still others defend the malignant transformation of cells with persistent embryonic potential [6-9].The imaging presentation of extrarenal Wilms' tumour is similar to intrarenal Wilms' tumour.CT and MRI provide characterization of the mass, its local extension and additionally allow detection of distant metastases [7-9].Nowadays there is no accepted staging system for extrarenal Wilms' tumour, so the system NWTS (National Wilms Tumor Study), which has the largest number of documented cases, has been used [2-4,10].The recommended management of true extrarenal Wilms' tumour includes a thorough staging, detailed pathologic classification, post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy [8-9,11].The prognosis is comparable to intrarenal Wilms' tumour.",Extrarenal Wilms' tumourRhabdomyosarcomaLymphomaNeuroblastomaGerm cell tumour of extragonadal origin,Extrarenal Wilms' tumour,4,15887;15803;13302;12442;11811;11636;9556,"Area of InterestAbdomen  ;Imaging TechniqueUltrasound,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,729,Extrarenal Wilms\' tumour,"{""A"": ""Neuroblastoma"", ""B"": ""Rhabdomyosarcoma"", ""C"": ""Extrarenal Wilms' tumour"", ""D"": ""Lymphoma"", ""E"": ""Germ cell tumour of extragonadal origin""}",C,Extrarenal Wilms' tumour,B,C,"[""EURORAD/Extrarenal Wilms\\' tumour/RJRJIOKd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Extrarenal Wilms\\' tumour/Ln1DHtyL.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Extrarenal Wilms\\' tumour/TwVxwEaP.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Extrarenal Wilms\\' tumour/uj24UH-N.jpg""]","[""Well-defined solid heterogeneous mass, without calcification, with small cystic areas; located above the bladder."", ""Axial CT of the abdomen showed a well defined lobulated, large soft tissue density mass in the pelvic region.

She could not open the eye completely but motor and visual functions were preserved. The lesion had appeared two months before and had been initially diagnosed as a chalazion.","The CT examination performed after administration of contrast medium shows a solid and roundish formation of 25 x 18 mm in the left upper eyelid; positive lymph nodes are not documented.In view of the suspected diagnosis of malignant tumour, a biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia.The MR examination demonstrated an exophytic lesion with signs of haemorrhage inside, in relation to the previous biopsy; the lesion appears markedly hydrated with smooth and regular margins and the eyeball does not seem to be infiltrated.The tumour tissue immunohistochemical study proved positive for neuronal specific enolase (NSE), sinaptofisina, CD56, PAN-CK and CK AE1/AE3.However, imaging characteristics are aspecific and the role of imaging is limited to the description of extension of the lesion as to the eyebal, pre and postseptal fat planes, lacrimal gland and temporal muscle.","Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive skin cancer that was recently linked to a previously unknown polyomavirus. It occurs more frequently in immunosuppressed individuals, and many patients have a history of other cancers, suggesting that MCC may also share etiologic factors with other malignancies [1-3].The tumour most often affects older patients (>60 years) with a predilection for women (M:F=1:3), it is a frequently lethal skin cancer that has a high propensity for nodal metastases and local recurrence [4].Merkel cells secrete neuropeptides which act as paracrine type regulators of neighbouring epidermal structures and their attachments [5].It is generally believed that this cell derives from an epithelial totipotent cell that can be differentiated from both neuroendocrine cells and keratinocytes. Generally, the tumour involves the skin of the head and neck (50%), extremities (40%), trunk and mucous membranes (10%). There have also been reports of multiple locations of the disease. The neoplasm typically occurs as a solitary, collected or plaque lesion, reddish-purple in colour with a glossy surface sometimes associated with telangiectasia veins. The epidermis may be intact or ulcerated. In the initial stage of disease the lesion can be confused with basal or spinocellular carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, skin metastases of small cell carcinoma, retinoblastoma, Ewing sarcoma and neuroblastoma, angiosarcoma, and, if palpebral, with a chalazion [6].MCC diagnosis is histological and immunohistochemical but CT and MR images are essential for assessing the size and the characteristics of the tumour, besides the involvement of surrounding tissues, lymph node positivity and the presence of distant metastases.There are 3 groups of disease: stage I, localised disease; stage II, regional nodal metastases; stage III, systemic disease. In stage I, surgery is the treatment of choice (nowadays the technique of sentinel lymph node is often used [7]) followed with radiation treatment whenever possible. In stage II excision of the primary lesion, removal of regional lymph node chains and radiotherapy are all performed. Local recurrence may occur on the skin (23%-60%) or on the regional lymph nodes (40%-73%). In stage III metastases mainly affect the liver, lungs, skeleton or skin, and chemotherapy is performed. At present, the correct therapeutic strategy for MCC is radical and aggressive removal of the tumour at an early stage in order to reduce the percentage of later relapses and improve survival [8].In our case the lesion was removed with wide margin of resection and then the eyelid was reconstructed using the temporal muscle.",Merkel cell carcinomaSkin metastases of small cell carcinomaChalazionBasal carcinomaSpinocellular carcinomaKeratoacanthomaEwing sarcomaNeuroblastomaAngiosarcoma,Merkel cell carcinoma,16,16278;10107;9823;9522,"Area of InterestEyes  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  Image manipulation / Reconstruction,  MRProcedureDiagnostic procedure,  Intraoperative;Special FocusNeoplasia;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,744,Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC),"{""A"": ""Skin metastases of small cell carcinoma"", ""B"": ""Angiosarcoma"", ""C"": ""Neuroblastoma"", ""D"": ""Keratoacanthoma"", ""E"": ""Merkel cell carcinoma""}",E,Merkel cell carcinoma,,E,"[""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/p1G9bSQ5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/RoPChhIz.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/7delRKrB.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/7CMr5lKK.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/oeCKzYdA.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/wVCfh5SV.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/vKaeVRWX.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/b5M4Ry7D.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/ha43Pm5F.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/sT5qASbI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/QeDfd4qX.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/WOMo5-Z4.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/shf25UiT.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/gSuGXrzx.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/LgLcVVA8.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)/4YwPndDa.jpg""]","[""Axial CT images performed after contrast administration shows an enhanced lesion, which does not appear to affect the bone."", ""Axial CT images performed after contrast administration shows the enhanced lesion, which does not appear to affect the bone."", ""Axial CT images performed after contrast administration shows the enhanced lesion, which does not appear to affect the bone."", ""Axial CT images performed after contrast administration shows the enhanced lesion, which does not appear to affect the bone."", ""Coronal STIR image shows a possible tail like extension of the lesion to the fat plane over the left temporal region\n(not confirmed at histology)."", ""Axial STIR image shows a possible tail like extension of the lesion to the fat plane over the left temporal region\n(not confirmed at histology)."", ""T1w axial image without fat saturation.\nAbsence of fatty cleavage plane between the lesion and eyeball.\nThe lesion cannot be delineated of the lacrimal sac."", ""T1w axial image without fat saturation.\nAbsence of fatty cleavage plane between the lesion and eyeball.\nThe lesion cannot be delineated of the lacrimal sac."", ""This T1w image with fat saturation shows  a punctiform hyperintense spot inside the lesion, likely haemorrhage in relation to the previous biopsy.\nThe lesion cannot be delineated of the lacrimal sac."", ""An image of the enormous tumor mass on the left upper eyelid, purple, rapidly growing and not painful."", ""An image of the enormous tumor mass on the left upper eyelid, purple, rapidly growing and not painful."", ""Axial bone window CT images performed after contrast administration shows the enhanced lesion, which does not appear to affect the bone."", ""T1w coronal image without fat saturation. \nAbsence of fatty cleavage plane between the lesion and eyeball."", ""Post contrast T1w images show a tenuous and inhomogeneous enhancement of the lesion, in the form of hyperintense streaks.\nThe lesion cannot be delineated of the lacrimal sac."", ""This image show the surgical results as to the delineation to the lacrimal sac and the lacrimal gland: histology confirmed that they are not infiltrated."", ""This image show the tumor adherent to the upper eyelid.

Physical examination revealed a palpable mass with no associated skin changes or superficial lesions. No neck nodes were palpable.","An orthopantomography showed a large expansive lesion in the right side of the mandible with lytic characteristics.A head and neck CT without contrast medium (Fig. 1) showed a 4 x 5.5 cm mass lesion situated in the right masticatory space, originating from the posterior mandibular ramus. The mass was cystic with a unilocular pattern and scalloped borders associated with thinning and defects of the bone cortex.An MRI with contrast medium (Fig. 2) was performed in order to better evaluate the morphology of the lesion. The lesion showed a high signal intensity in T2 weighted sequences and low signal intensity in T1 weighted sequences, due to fluid content. It had a cyst-like appearance with an enhancing peripheral rim showing an intramural enhancing soft tissue nodule on the medial aspect of the cystic wall.","Ameloblastoma is an odontogenic tumour thought to originate from central mandibular or maxillary odontogenic epithelium [1, 2]. It represents about 1% of oral tumours and is the most common odontogenic tumour (35%). Its peak incidence is in the 3rd-4th decades, while other cystic lesions of the mandible and maxilla (e.g. aneurismal bone cyst) are more common during childhood [3]. Similar to dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts it most commonly occurs in the mandible (80%), particulary in the posterior mandibular ramus [1, 4]. There are several histological sub-types, however, radiologically we are not able to distinguish them all [2, 5].The tumour is often clinically asymptomatic and slow-growing. In most cases it is histologically benign, but can be locally aggressive with increased risk of local recurrence if not adequately treated (estimated recurrence rate 33%). Late signs include loose teeth and bleeding. It is often associated with an unerupted 3rd molar and in most cases >2 cm in size at diagnosis. Malignant transformation is rare (1%).Radiologically we can classify them in 3 groups: peripheral, unicystic and multicystic. The multicystic type is the most common (86%), with various cysts grouped together or separated by osseous septa [1, 4]. The most relevant diagnostic pattern is a ＆bubbly＊, multilocular, mixed cystic-solid mass. In these multicystic cases it is easier to distinguish between ameloblastoma and odontogenic cystic abnormalities (example dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts) which often present as unilocular cystic lesions. In cases of unicystic ameloblastomas this distinction is harder. Contrast-enhanced CT (and MRI) could show either small contrast-enhancing nodular lesions within the cystic wall or larger lesions with surrounding soft-tissue enhancement mixed with cystic areas. These enhancing nodules are an important feature for differential diagnosis, particularly with dentigerous cysts when also associated with an unerupted 3rd molar. MRI is indicated to assess involvement of neurovascular structures and extraosseous components, even though they are rare. T1-weighted images show a mixed signal intensity or typical low signal intensity. T2-weigthed images usually show high signal intensity due to fluid content. MRI is useful for differential diagnosis with odontogenic keratocysts since fluid content of odontogenic keratocysts is more proteinacious and viscous, and therefore does not show such a high signal intensity [6]. Differential diagnosis between larger dentigerous cysts, odontogenic keratocysts and unicystic ameloblastoma may be difficult, and sometimes can only be confirmed histologicaly [6].Complete surgical excision is indicated for small lesions while en bloc removal is recommended for larger ones [1, 7].",AmeloblastomaMetastatic lesion of follicular carcinoma of the thyroid glandDentigerous cystOdontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumour)Aneurysmal bone cystAmeloblastoma,Ameloblastoma,9,9905,"Area of InterestHead and neck  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  MRProcedureStaging;Special FocusCysts;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,747,Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day),"{""A"": ""Odontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumour)"", ""B"": ""Ameloblastoma"", ""C"": ""Ameloblastoma"", ""D"": ""Dentigerous cyst"", ""E"": ""Metastatic lesion of follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland""}",B,Ameloblastoma,E,B,"[""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/qE9Q-up4.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/7q2yRXPG.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/CAmss2yr.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/Do43a-79.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/UjH0t5Im.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/ALxHPjJ0.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/5e-c5-37.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/lr9qv1J5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/eKAIjcma.jpg""]","[""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Coronal MRI T2-weighted image.""]"
