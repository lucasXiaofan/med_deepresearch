**Date**: 2025/6/9

## Clinical History
A 27-year-old nulliparous female came for her first antenatal scan at 32 weeks of gestation with no prior early antenatal scans. She presented with a bilobed abdominal contour seen externally as two distinct bulges with a central vertical depression. No earlier imaging had been done.


## Question
what is the final diagnosis
**Options**:
A. Gravid bicornuate uterus with intercornual communication  
B. Gravid didelphys uterus with partial fusion  
C. Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation  
D. Gravid arcuate uterus with exaggerated indentation  
E. Gravid uterus with intrauterine synechiae or band  

**Correct Answer**: C (Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation)

## Imaging Findings
An ultrasound examination revealed a thin central septum partially dividing the uterus into two hemicavities. The amniotic sac was seen occupying both the uterine hemicavities. The foetus was viable, with the foetal abdomen and lower extremities seen in the right hemicavity, and the foetal head and upper extremities extending into the left hemicavity across the central septum (Figures 1 and 2). Nearly two-thirds of the placenta was implanted on the left side of the central septum, with the rest of it implanted on the anterior wall of the left hemicavity (Figure 3). No vascularity was detected in the uterine septum on Doppler ultrasound.

## Discussion
**Background**: A uterine septum is a congenital Müllerian anomaly where a fibrous or fibromuscular band divides the endometrial cavity partially or completely. It results from incomplete resorption of the medial walls of the fused Müllerian ducts. The septum is typically avascular and poorly distensible, which can impair implantation and placental development in pregnancy [3,4].

**Clinical Perspective**: In a septate uterus, pregnancy typically occurs in one hemicavity, as the septum restricts expansion into both sides, with implantation usually occurring on the well-vascularised lateral wall [2,3]. In rare cases, pregnancy can continue despite placental implantation on the septum, representing an unusual presentation as mentioned in some case reports, and cited in Calis et al. (2018) and in Martinez?Pe?uela et al. (2019) [1,6]. Such cases may lead to complications like foetal growth restriction or preterm birth, yet may occasionally result in successful outcomes with close monitoring [1,3,4]. Hence, in such cases, ultrasound monitoring of placental location and foetal growth is needed [5,6].

**Imaging Perspective**: Diagnostic pearls include a narrowed uterine contour with persistent midline echo and extension of the gestational sac across the septum. Key findings include abnormal uterine shape on 2D ultrasound, placental tissue implanted on the midline septum and foetal parts extending across the septum to occupy both uterine cavities. Final diagnosis is best confirmed with 3D ultrasound, MRI or hysteroscopy, which clearly delineate the septum, uterine morphology, and placental location [1,6].

**Outcome**: Therapeutic options in pregnancies with a septate uterus and placental implantation on the septum are limited to close monitoring, as surgical correction (metroplasty) is contraindicated during pregnancy [1,4]. Prognosis depends on septum vascularity and placental function; risks include miscarriage, growth restriction, and preterm labour [1,4,5]. Imaging plays a crucial role in therapy planning—3D ultrasound and MRI help assess septal extent, placental location, and foetal growth, guiding surveillance strategies and delivery planning to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes in these rare presentations [1].

**Take Home Message / Teaching Points**:
*   Placental implantation on the uterine septum is a rare condition that clinicians should be aware of during antenatal care.
*   Accurate diagnosis requires the use of advanced imaging techniques, which can help differentiate it from more common placental positions.
*   Once diagnosed, these cases need close monitoring for potential foetal growth restriction and placental insufficiency.
*   A carefully planned delivery strategy is essential to minimise maternal and foetal risks.
