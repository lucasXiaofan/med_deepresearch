Case number 10128,2012/6/18,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10128,A 43-year-old gentleman presented with neurological symptoms and CT of the head was abnormal with signs of hydrocephalus. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy relieved the pressure symptoms of hydrocephalus and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Further neurosurgery was not possible and the patient underwent radical radiotherapy with good response.,"The differential diagnosis of masses in the region of pineal gland includes (their distinguishing radiological features are given in brackets) [1];?	Pineal cyst (well circumscribed fluid density lesions)?	Primary Pineal tumours (radiological features vary depending upon grade of the lesion. Low grade pineocytomas are better defined and high grade pineoblastomas are poorly defined. As these originate from pineocytes, the masses are usually calcified)?	Germ cell tumours (contrast enhancing soft tissue density masses and intrinsic calcification is uncommon, these tend to engulf normal pineal gland calcification)?	Secondary metastases (in the majority of cases there is evidence of primary disease elswhere)?	Vascular lesions (radiographically distinct lesions with no soft tissue mass effect with possible associated dilated vessels or vascular aneurysms)","A 43-year-old previously fit and healthy gentleman presented with progressively worsening symptoms of early morning headaches, nausea, dizziness and vision blurring. CT examination showed space occupied lesion. MRI revealed enhancing pineal mass with signs of hydrocephalus. He underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy, and a biopsy was taken. Symptoms of hydrocephalus resolved and the pathology confirmed WHO grade IV Pineoblastoma (Ki67 >40%).Futher surgical resection was not feasible due to operative risks. MRI of the spine did not show any abnormality and lumber puncture revealed highly suspicious for malignant cells �C Chang stage M3. Serum tumour markers, AFP and HCG levels were normal. A diagnosis of high grade pineoblastoma was made and the patient was offered craniospinal irradiation. He received 40.8 Gray in 24 fractions to cranio-spinal axis and 15.3 Gray in 9 fractions as a boost to the pineal tumour. He developed alopecia and grade 1 scalp erythema. Soon after completion of his tumour, he was admitted with sepsis secondary to bilateral pneumonias which was treated accordingly. He made a full recovery. Post treatment, he was also found to have low cortisol and increased ACTH levels. Endocrinology opinion was obtained and it was felt that the picture was consistent with partial hypoadrenalism likely secondary to exogenous use of steroids. There was no significant evidence of hypopituitrism. He was commenced on steroid replacement and recovered very well. Repeat MRI three months after completion of radiotherapy showed good response to the treatment.Pineal region tumours are rare, <1% of all intracranial tumours (in children, 3-8%) [2]. Germ cell tumours are more common in this region. Pineocytomas are more common than Pineoblastoma, which are extremely rare. Maximum possible surgery is treatment of choice. Radiotherpay is used adjuvantly and radically in case of residual disease post surgery [3]. In case of metastasis (like in this case as CSF was positive for malignant cells), craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is treatment of choice. It is associated with side effects e.g. tiredness, emesis, skin reaction, alopecia, bone marrow suppression, headaches, sleep and memory disturbance. It can also affect the pituitary function due to some unavoidable dose to the pituitary gland. The patient needs to be under regular follow up with surveillance images. The prognosis depends on histological type, size of the tumour and extent of disease at presentation [4]. Surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy results in median survival of 20 months [2].",PineoblastomaIntracranial Germ cell tumourMeningiomaTectal GliomaDermoidPrimitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET),Pineoblastoma,8,16214;16065;15798;15589;15616;15514;15380;15399;15287;15251;14955;14906;14911;14804;14734;14731;14706;14314;14216;14267;14063;13843;13910;13604;13729;13099;13562;13477;13332;13379;13385;13254;13265;13259;13074;12553;12718;12780;12716;12513;12584;12629;12439;12426;9428;12075;12021;11937;11933;11542;11284;11315;11202;11206;11068;10868;10792;10724;10651;10128;9972;9982;9901;9886;9500;9719,"Area of InterestNeuroradiology brain,  Neuroradiology spine  ;Imaging TechniqueMR,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,81,Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy,"{""A"": ""Meningioma"", ""B"": ""Dermoid"", ""C"": ""Tectal Glioma"", ""D"": ""Intracranial Germ cell tumour"", ""E"": ""Pineoblastoma""}",E,Pineoblastoma,D,E,"[""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/4VsJ6fWQ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/ZmzDvJgV.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/iUsRAfIr.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/ycc8sYUp.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/FCW499L3.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/kuqb7sM7.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/y_GDej8C.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Pineoblastoma: A case of good response to radiotherapy/SkX22wdC.jpg""]","[""CT showed mid line tumour with signs of hydrocephalus."", ""Sagittal section of MRI revealing a tumour obstructing the ventricles."", ""Coronal section of MRI revealing the tumour."", ""Radiotherapy techniques showing multiple fields, delivering radiotherapy dose to the tumour."", ""Craniospinal irradiation.

Case number 10146,2012/10/8,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10146,62-year-old male patient presented with soft tissue swelling at the volar side of the wrist. There was no history of trauma and no reference of neurological signs. History of colon cancer was present.,"A 62-year-old male patient, with a slow-growing mass of the right wrist, was referred to the radiology department for evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in the axial and sagittal planes. An oval-shaped mass of 48 x 12 x 10 mm was depicted in the carpal tunnel. The tumor showed low to intermediate signal on T1 weighted images(Fig.1a) and inhomogeneous predominantly low signal on T2 (Fig.1b). After intravenous contrast administration (Fig.1c), the tumor showed inhomogeneous enhancement (Fig.2). Peripheral enhancement extends around an ulnar sided flexor tendon. The tumor was surgically excised and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.","Tendon sheath fibroma (TSF) is a rare dense, slow growing benign soft tissue tumor attached to a tendon sheath. It presents as a small subcutaneous nodule that slowly increases in size. Tendon sheath fibromas often occur in the fingers, hands and toes. The onset is usually marked by noticing a small mass or swelling [1, 2]. It is difficult to diagnose TSF by clinical examination, since ganglion cyst or giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCTTS) are much more common [3].Radiographs are usually normal. Ultrasound can depict the correlation of the mass with the surrounding structures with dynamic imaging. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation. A TSF appears as a well defined nodular mass abutting the tendon sheath. On T1-weighted images it shows signal intensity equal to or lower than that of skeletal muscle. On T2-weighted images, heterogeneous predominantly low signal intensity is seen, correlating to dense collagenous tissue. However, more cellular areas can be seen in the early stages of tumor development, exhibiting mild to intense enhancement after Gd administration [1, 3, 4, 5]. In our case fluid is seen in the carpal tunnel as well, probably secondary to surmenage.Differential diagnosis includes a GCTTS, which is more common. The hemosiderin deposition, seen as susceptibility artifacts on gradient echo sequences, is diagnostic. A GCTTS occurs more frequently in the lower extremities than TSF, while TSF usually occurs in the younger adult population and especially men [2, 3]. Radiologically, bone erosion is not a common finding in TSF compared to GCTTS. More cellular forms of TSF show enhancement and in case of a peripheral zone of enhancement, nodular fasciitis has to be considered. However, characteristic for nodular fasciitis is its rapid growth in weeks. Nodular fasciitis can be suggested when the mass extends along the fascia and is not associated with tendon sheath [4]. In addition, in cellular forms of TSF, fibrous histiocytoma and fibrosarcoma have to be considered as well. However, a fibrous histiocytoma can be found in skin and muscle, preferably in the lower limb and head and neck region [5]. Finally in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of reumatoid nodules can be appreciated fixed to the tendons. The final diagnosis is made microscopically based on the different histologic features. Treatment is by local surgical excision with preservation of the tendon, with a reported recurrence of 24% [2]",Fibroma of the tendon sheath.Giant-cell tumor of tendon sheathGanglion cystNodular fasciitisFibrous histiocytomaRheumatoid nodule,Fibroma of the tendon sheath.,6,18111;17790;17016;16260;16224;16072;15907;15826;15595;15509;15586;15458;14993;14716;14222;14060;13960;13580;12495;12132;11508;11555;11509;10854;10259;10146;10100;9578,Area of InterestMusculoskeletal soft tissue  ;Imaging TechniqueMRProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,86,Fibroma of the tendon sheath,"{""A"": ""Fibroma of the tendon sheath."", ""B"": ""Ganglion cyst"", ""C"": ""Giant-cell tumor of tendon sheath"", ""D"": ""Fibrous histiocytoma"", ""E"": ""Nodular fasciitis""}",A,Fibroma of the tendon sheath.,C,A,"[""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/mh-qhmui.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/QUcmV0NI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/cih5ximd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/NDNcv67C.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/bfmSA3Zk.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Fibroma of the tendon sheath/dbF_hfUz.jpg""]","[""Axial T1WTSE image of the wrist shows a lobulated mass in the carpal tunnel.

Case number 10280,2014/2/17,https://www.eurorad.org/case/10280,"A 65 year old man with previous coronary bypass, hypertension and diabetes, was admitted with increasing mid chest pain radiating to the back, dysphagia and dyspnea. On clinical examination there were no relevant findings.Normal blood pressure, heart rate and temperature. Normal ECG and MNMs.Laboratory findings revealed type II respiratory failure.","A chest radiography revealed a hazy opacity in the left lung base(Fig.1). Angio chest CT pointed out lower left lung bronchiectasis (Fig.2), no signs of pulmonary-thromboembolism, and a 3. 5 cm sized saccular aneurysm resulting from penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer in the mid third of the descending aorta (Fig.3, 4).24 hours later, while treated conservatively with large spectrum antibiotics, his condition worsened with tachycardia and hypotension.Endoscopy mentioned no significant hemorrhagic findings.Unenhanced CT revealed a bulge in the left antero-medial aspect of the descending thoracic aorta, effacement of the periaortic fat plane along with gas bubbles surrounding the aortic wall(Fig.5). Enhanced sequences showed these abnormalities related to an enlarged (4.2 cm sized) saccular aneurysm with hazy aortic wall, intramural air (Figs.6, 7) and revealed a small amount of contrast extravasation in the gastric fundus(Fig.8).The patient was submitted to an emergency surgical intervention with poor outcome, confirming the presence of an aortoesophageal fistula.","The aortoenteric fistula, a rare but potentially fatal entity, is a significant challenge to radiologists when it come to diagnosis , specially because of its subtle and nonspecific imaging findings. An early diagnosis is fundamental for patient survival.The cardinal clinical signs include hematemesis, melena, sepsis, and abdominal pain, but the condition may also be clinically occult. [1, 2]Considering clinical signs may not be present or may not be sufficiently specific, imaging is most often necessary to achieve an accurate diagnosis.CT has a variable specificity (33%�C100%) and sensitivity (40%�C90%) for the diagnosis of aortoenteric fistulas.[3, 4] For an effective use of this modality in the initial diagnostic examination, radiologists must be familiar with the spectrum of CT appearances.Aortoesophageal fistulas are divided into primary and secondary forms, depending on the presence or absence of prior aortic reconstructive surgery. [5]Primary aortoenteric fistulas occur in a native aorta without a history of prior intervention and are much more rare than secondary fistula. Causes include atherosclerotic penetrating ulcer (most common) , foreign bodies, aortitis, esophageal malignancies. [6, 7]Secondary aortoenteric fistulas occur in the setting of prior surgery or intervention, in patients with prior aortic surgery or graft placement. [8]Primary CT findings involves ectopic gas either within or directly adjacent to the aortic lumen. [1] Rarely, gas can be traced from the esophagus to the aorta. [3]Direct extravasation of contrast from the aorta into the esophagus and leakage of enteric contrast directly into the periaortic space are extraordinarily rare.[2, 3]Secondary CT findings encompasses effacement of the periaortic fat plane, focal thickening and tethering of a esophageal wall immediately adjacent to the aorta, periaortic free fluid and soft tissue thickening, penetrating ulcer or intramural hematoma immediately adjacent to a tethered, abnormal appearing esophagus.[9]Mimics of aortoenteric fistulas are severe perigraft infection, aortitis, mycotic aneurysms, perianeurysmal fibrosis and immediate post-operative aorta [2, 3, 4]Differentiation is aided by the observation of ectopic gas, loss of the normal fat plane, extravasation of aortic contrast material into the enteric lumen, or leakage of enteric contrast material into the paraprosthetic space; these features are highly suggestive of aortoenteric fistula in a patient with bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract [1,7,10].Classical treatment involves surgical ressection of the infected graft, esophageal ressection, creation of an extra-anatomic vascular bypass graft. Mortality rates are up to 90%. Modern treatment trend implies endovascular techniques, lower risk of perioperative complications, avoids most catastrophic complications after surgery [11].",Aortoesophageal fistulaPenetrating atherosclerotic ulcerInfectious aortiitisMycotic aneurysmPerigraft infection,Aortoesophageal fistula,8,17906;16337;15543;14653;13432;12604;11994;11745;11935;10280;11413;11073;10504;10489;10388;10361;10208;9799;9603,"Area of InterestVascular,  Arteries / Aorta,  Lung  ;Imaging TechniqueConventional radiography,  CT-Angiography,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusAneurysms;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,98,Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm,"{""A"": ""Mycotic aneurysm"", ""B"": ""Perigraft infection"", ""C"": ""Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer"", ""D"": ""Infectious aortiitis"", ""E"": ""Aortoesophageal fistula""}",E,Aortoesophageal fistula,C,E,"[""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/Cuif0Mvd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/ktrFMg-s.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/w1l3KhZd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/rrQtO6ts.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/gmPYSflA.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/zHDGjeFd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/UR8KELHa.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Aortoesophageal fistula resulting from mycotic aneurysm/DRPLWaip.jpg""]","[""Chest X-ray revealed a  hazy opacity and slight  increase in bronchovascular markings in the lower left hemithorax.

Case number 11692,2014/5/5,https://www.eurorad.org/case/11692,"A 17-year-old male patient presented with a two-day history of periumbilical pain having migrated into the right lower quadrant, associated with vomiting and nausea. There was no previous abdominal surgery or other significant medical history. Blood tests revealed a moderately elevated C-reactive protein (15 mg/l), without leukocytosis.","Abdominal sonography showed a hypoechoic tubular 6 mm blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant, adjacent to the caecum and consistent with a normal appendix (Fig. 1a). A second incompressive tubular structure was visualized in a slightly more cranial location, with a maximal diameter of 17 mm. This second structure contained hyperechoic air as well as hypoechoic debris (Fig. 1b). There were associated enlarged lymph nodes (not shown); no abscess or free air were seen.Intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was then performed, about two hours after oral contrast media administration, showing the second tubular blind-ending structure to be developed from a thickened terminal ileum, with stranding of the surrounding fat and multiple lymph nodes (Fig. 2a, b), consistent with an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. The appendix and the rest of the abdomen were normal (Fig. 2c).The anatomopathological examination showed acute inflammation, perforation and haemorrhagic changes of the Meckel's diverticulum (Fig. 3).","Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract [1, 2]. It is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct, which normally involutes in the embryologic period between 10-12 weeks of gestational age [3]. Meckel's diverticulum contains three intestinal wall layers, making it a true diverticulum. The mucosa may consist either of normal intestinal epithelium or of ectopic gastric mucosa (in 45-80% of cases), in rare cases pancreatic mucosa may be found [4]. The location is variable among individual patients, but the diverticulum's base is usually found 50-100 cm upstream of the ileocecal valve [1, 5]. Its lenght is up to 10 cm. Meckel's diverticulum is present in 2-3% of the general population, with no gender predilection, however, men are more likely to develop complications [4]. Overall, only 4-6% of Meckel's diverticulae become symptomatic, the incidence of complications decreasing with age [4].Typical symptoms of complicated Meckel's diverticulum differ between age groups. Rectal bleeding is the most common presentation in children whereas intestinal obstruction occurs more often in adults [1, 2, 6]. Meckel's diverticulitis is the second most common complication in adults, present in 12-53% of symptomatic patients, caused by acid secretion from ectopic gastric mucosa in the diverticulum or by obstruction, in particular through enteroliths, and subsequent bacterial infection [1, 7].Ultrasound is usually the starting examination for right lower quadrant abdominal pain, in particular to exclude acute appendicitis. Meckel's diverticulitis may lead to misdiagnosis by simulating not only appendicitis symptoms, but also through mimicking its ultrasound apperance [3]. If the inflamed structure's origin cannot be reliably determined by ultrasound, CT with oral and intravenous contrast media usually allows to establish the diagnosis. Positive key features for Meckel's diverticulitis include an origin on the antimesenteric border of the terminal ileum and luminal communication. The presence of thickened mucosa helps differentiate it from an enteric duplication cyst. A persistent omphalomesenteric artery may be followed to its origin from the superior mesenteric artery, this artery being the bleeding source in haemorrhagic diverticulae. A helpful negative key feature is a normal appendix [3].Treatment of Meckel's diverticulitis is surgical, either by open procedure or laparoscopy [1].In conclusion, Meckel's diverticulum is present in 2-3% of the population and rarely becomes symptomatic. Meckel's diverticulitis has to be borne in mind as a clinical and ultrasound mimicker of acute appendicitis.

Case number 11845,2014/5/29,https://www.eurorad.org/case/11845,50-year-old man with lower back pain. MRI ordered to investigate suspected lumbar disc herniation.,"MRI of the lumbar spine shows multiple intradural extramedullary masses in the lumbosacral spine. The largest is at L2-L3, sausage-shaped, and measures 11x16x45 mm. Smaller ovoid masses are at L4, L4-L5, and S1. They are heterogeneously hyperintense on T2WI, isointense on T1WI, and intensely enhancing on T1WI C+. They do not protrude into the neural foramina. There are no associated cysts, and there is no associated haemorrhage or scalloping of the vertebral bodies. MRI of the head and complete spine excluded the presence of additional lesions.","Myxopapillary ependymoma (ME) is a slow-growing glioma almost exclusively found in the region of the conus medullaris, filum terminale, and cauda equina [1]. Little is known about its aetiology [2], as it is very rare--227 intradural spinal ependymomas occur in the US annually [3]. The average age at diagnosis is 36.4 years, although the range is 6 to 82 [4], and it is twice as common in men as in women [1]. This neoplasm arises from the ependymal glia of the filum terminale [3] and is highly vascular [2]. It is typically intradural and extramedullary [5] and is grossly ovoid [1], lobular or sausage-shaped, and encapsulated [3]. It is regarded as relatively benign and slow-growing [6], WHO grade I [4], and rarely spreads distantly, although this can happen, particularly if its capsule is perforated [7]. Multiple lesions can be found in 14-43% of cases [8].Clinically, ME mimics discogenic pathology by manifesting as lower back pain [5]--diagnosis is often delayed until 2 years after onset [1]. Radiculopathy [5], sciatica, saddle sensory loss, and bowel dysfunction have been seen in some cases [8]. MRI is the best modality for intraspinal disease [9], and is essential to identifying additional lesions and planning treatment [8].On MRI, the ME is well-circumscribed and generally spans 2-4 vertebral segments [1]. It is T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense [1], although it can be hyperintense on both due to accumulated mucin or haemorrhage [8]. It is intensely enhancing with contrast [1]. It compresses, rather than infiltrates, adjacent structures [10]. 50% of cases are associated with cysts, which contrast helps delineate, and 19% involve haemosiderin deposits suggestive of haemorrhage [11]. Hence, appearance may be heterogeneous. 63% demonstrate osseous changes, such as scalloping of the vertebral bodies or erosion of medial pedicles [11]. It is responsible for 83% of neoplasms involving the filum terminale [8].Complete surgical resection is the optimal treatment [4] and results in excellent prognosis [1]. In subtotal resections or nonsurgical candidates, adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary site is recommended to prevent recurrence [12]. After radiotherapy, patients should be followed yearly for 6-8 years [13]. In this patient, the largest lesion was excised, and the others were irradiated. At 8 year follow-up, the irradiated lesions remain but are smaller, and there is no recurrence of the largest lesion.ME is a rare cause of back pain, detectable on MRI, that is the most likely neoplasm in the filum terminale.",Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology)Drop metastasesSchwannomaEpendymomaNeurofibroma,Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology),5,16110;15518;14804;11845;10792,Area of InterestSpine  ;Imaging TechniqueMRProcedureDiagnostic procedure;Special FocusNeoplasia;,clinical_history+imaging_findings,204,Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI,"{""A"": ""Ependymoma"", ""B"": ""Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology)"", ""C"": ""Neurofibroma"", ""D"": ""Drop metastases"", ""E"": ""Schwannoma""}",B,Ependymoma (confirmed by pathology),E,B,"[""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/Q3e0L39c.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/T0CtxyTJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/WU0N_VmC.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/x7PKq6ff.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Spinal ependymoma diagnosed on MRI/__sFnwi_.jpg""]","[""T1WI sagittal view of lumbar spine showing isointensity of ependymoma."", ""T1WI C+ sagittal view of lumbar spine showing hetereogeneously contrast-enhancing masses and venous ectasia around the conus medullaris.

Case number 12185,2014/11/25,https://www.eurorad.org/case/12185,A 7-year-old girl presented with a large abdominal mass. The mass had been increasing in size over the past month and was associated with abdominal discomfort and weight loss.,"Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a large, ill-defined, mixed solid and cystic vascular mass lesion (Fig. 1a-c). On MR imaging, the lesion was demonstrated to have mass effect on adjacent organs. STIR sequence did not show any fat suppression, suggesting that the contents were fluid (Fig. 2a). Coronal (Fig. 2a) and axial (Fig. 2b) T2w images confirmed the mass to be predominantly cystic. The mass was seen displacing adjacent bowel loops and the mesenteric vessels. The stomach was displaced anteriorly, the spleen superiorly and the pancreas to the right side. The location of the mass was presumed in the retroperitoneum. It was seen in close proximity to the left renal artery. The left renal vein was not identified and was possibly compressed or encased by the mass. Severe left hydronephrosis was noted secondary to mass effect on the proximal left ureter (Fig. 2f).","Nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTSs) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal cell neoplasms that account for about 4% of childhood cancers [1, 4].Soft tissue sarcomas are rare paediatric tumours classified by the WHO according to histologic cell types [2]. 40% are rhabdomyosarcomas and 60% are NRSTS [2]. Paediatric NRSTS behave differently than the adult varieties, hence causing this dilemma [1].The pathogenesis is due to the lack of tumour suppressing genes; p53 and retinoblastoma suppressing gene, resulting in limitless replication, invasion and metastatic growth [1].Four categories of biological potential are included: benign, intermediate�Clocally aggressive, intermediate�Crarely metastasizing, and malignant [1].The types of soft tissue sarcoma based on histology include [2]: Alveolar soft part sarcoma, angiosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, desmoid tumour, desmoplastic small round cell tumour, epithelioid sarcoma, extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, haemangiopericytoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant schwannoma and synovial sarcoma.Ultrasound is the first radiological investigation in the work-up of paediatric abdominal masses. It is inexpensive, readily available, does not involve radiation and seldom requires sedation. Ultrasound identifies the organ of origin as well as the type of tissue components present (solid versus cystic). Magnetic resonance imaging provides excellent soft tissue definition, and is therefore preferable for surgical planning and following neoadjuvant therapy [3, 4, 5]. Staging is best done with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis. PET may be also used, however, it is an optional pretreatment assessment investigation only [6]. Imaging usually shows a soft tissue enhancing mass which may be partly cystic or solid. Histology of the abdominal mass in this patient shows cores of tissue composed of loose interfacing fascicles of plump spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and small nucleoli, surrounded by abundant loose fibrillary and myxoid stroma. No cytological atypia or necrosis is seen. Immunohistochemistry shows strong positivity for vimentin and beta-catenin, as well as patchy positivity for SMA and desmin. S100 and CD56 are negative. Differential diagnosis includes haemangioendothelioma, a liver tumour which may be mistaken for an abdominal mass. Lymphoma may also present as a large abdominal mass encasing the arteries.Treatment options are based on whether the cancer has spread, the amount of tumour left after surgery, and whether the child has reached full growth. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all treatment options, either alone or in combination with one another [2, 3, 4]. This patient was put on weekly Methotrexate plus vinblastine combination.

Case number 12691,2015/4/28,https://www.eurorad.org/case/12691,"A 66-year-old woman with history of chronic recurrent painful heel. On physical examination, there was no evidence of sensory loss.","Magnetic resonance imaging of the right foot performed with a high-resolution surface coil. Patient scanned in magnet of 1.5 T. The technical parameters for all magnet strengths were as follows: sagittal, coronal and axial short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) turbo spin echo, coronal turbo spin-echo proton density and T2-weighted and sagittal and coronal turbo spin echo T1-weighted.MR images show marked thickening of the proximal plantar fascia with increased intrasubstance signal intensity. Also perifascial and mild calcaneal marrow oedema.In association with these findings, there is selective fat tissue replacement of the abductor digiti minimi muscle.","Baxter's neuropathy is an entrapment syndrome of the inferior calcaneal nerve (ICN), which is the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve. It accounts for 20% of causes of medial heel pain, occasionally irradiating into the lateral aspect of the foot [1, 2, 3].Atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle reflects chronic compression of the ICN, which consist of loss of muscular mass of the affected muscle with fat tissue replacement (Fig. 1) [4]. MRI plays a key role since nerve entrapment at the foot and ankle involves thin and complex anatomic structures and is underdiagnosed because clinical symptoms and electrophysiologic findings may not contribute to the diagnosis [1]. In addition, opposite to MRI electromyography may not allow differentiation of lateral plantar nerve entrapment at the level of the tarsal tunnel from ICN entrapment [1].Entrapment of the ICN occurs at three possible places: (a) adjacent to the fascial edge of a hypertrophied abductor halluces muscle, (b) as the nerve passes between the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle and the medial caudal margin of the medial head of the quadratus plantae muscle or (c) most commonly where the nerve passes just anterior to the medial calcaneal tuberosity, where it is sometimes related with calcaneal spur and marked thickening of the proximal plantar fascia, as it is shown in our case (Fig. 2) [1, 4].Compression of the ICN may result from altered biomechanics, reflected by posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or Achilles tendinosis, or may result from direct mechanical compression of the nerve due to plantar fasciitis and/or plantar calcaneal spurs (Fig. 3) [2]. Recht et al reported plantar fasciitis in 37% of cases with abductor digiti quinti atrophy [4].Plantar fasciitis is referred in the literature as the most common cause of plantar heel pain [5, 6]. This condition generally occurs in obese middle-aged or elderly patients as a result of repetitive trauma from sport activities, excessive standing and walking [5, 6].In view of the present case, and in order to identify the proper imaging approach to the patient with heel pain, we recommend to assess findings of fatty infiltration of the abductor digiti minimi muscle, since it reflects chronic ICN entrapment.",Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitisIntramuscular abductor digiti minimi lipomaPlantar fibromatosisIsolated plantar fasciitisAbductor digiti minimi atrophy associated with plantar fasciitis (Baxter neuropathy: chronic ICN entrapment),Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis,8,16807;15628;16243;15725;15596;15125;15211;14975;14230;14821;14503;13129;12691;11778;11401;10992;10752;10523;10450;10157;10024;9818;9975;9743;9570,"Area of InterestExtremities,  Musculoskeletal soft tissue,  Neuroradiology peripheral nerve  ;Imaging TechniqueMRProcedureDiagnostic procedure,  Education;Special FocusInflammation;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,261,Baxter\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis,"{""A"": ""Intramuscular abductor digiti minimi lipoma"", ""B"": ""Isolated plantar fasciitis"", ""C"": ""Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis"", ""D"": ""Plantar fibromatosis"", ""E"": ""Abductor digiti minimi atrophy associated with plantar fasciitis (Baxter neuropathy: chronic ICN entrapment)""}",C,Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis,E,C,"[""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/J7bcWkwW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/Sx6M1Tag.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/zx1k8xBJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/JF7nxPsG.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/9RorwZiI.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/MmstIwFW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/5JK07dcP.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Baxter\\'s neuropathy: Isolated fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle in association with plantar fasciitis/MauC1FEw.jpg""]","[""Coronal T1 weighted TSE image shows the normal muscle anatomy.

He was febrile up to 39. On physical examination, the only finding was a distended abdomen. He had a history of hypertension.","Plain abdominal radiography showed one air-fluid level, as well as tube-like branching lucencies in the right upper quadrant (RUQ). Abdominal ultrasound (US) revealed a distended gallbladder with a transversal diameter of 50mm, containing sludge and an 11mm calculus. The gallbladder wall was irregularly thickened, up to 6mm. Computerised tomography (CT) scan confirmed the ultrasound findings in the gallbladder, with additional signs of severe inflammation indicating gangrenous cholecystitis, with wall disruption with multiple mural gas inclusions, including one air-liquid level in the lumen. It was reported that the wall-lining was irregular towards the D2-part of the duodenum, together with the gas inclusions in the lumen of the common bile duct. In the IV-segment of the liver, 8-millimeter hypodense zones surrounding the gallbladder were present pointing to abscessing areas.","Presented radiological and clinical findings may suggest a few potential diagnoses. Pneumobilia is described as the occurrence of free air in the gallbladder or biliary tree. There are a number of causes of pneumobilia, including surgically created biliary enteric fistula, instrumentation of the bile duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, an incompetent sphincter of Oddi, internal biliary fistula (IBF), emphysematous cholecystitis (EC), pyogenic cholangitis [1, 2]. Gas in the biliary tree is an infrequent finding in EC [2]. The initial diagnosis for our patient, following the presented radiological and clinical findings, was a spontaneous IBF. These fistulas are formed between the extrahepatic biliary tract and a variety of adjacent organs [3]. Our main suspicion was a choledochoduodenal fistula. In the study performed by Yamashita et al [3], it was found that all the patients that were proven to have a choledochoduodenal fistula had had gallstones in the gallbladder, and 44% of patient with IBF showed signs of pneumobilia on CT. An internal biliary fistula was excluded in our patient in surgery with intraoperative cholangiography. A gangrenous gallbladder was found with an abscess on the posterior wall and a cholecystectomy was performed. The patohistology finding confirmed the acute ulcero-gangrenous cholecystitis on a ground of chronic fibrinous cholecystitis, together with sero-fibrinous pericholecystitis. EC is a rare and severe variant of acute cholecystitis, characterised by gas production in and around the gallbladder wall [4]. Gas forming organisms, most frequently Chlostridium welchi and Echerichia coli, have often been identified in patients with this condition. They are postulated to thrive in anaerobic atmosphere of devitalised tissue resulting from vascular insufficiency of the gallbladder wall in arteriopathic patients [5-6]. Welch and Flexner first described this entity in 1896 [7]. Hegner first described its associated radiologist signs in 1931. Its clinical definition is based on the presence of air in the gallbladder lumen, wall or tissues surrounding the wall, in the absence of abnormal communication with the gastrointestinal tract [4]. The diagnosis of emphysematous cholecystitis often requires imaging techniques. The radiological diagnosis is based on the detection of gas within the gallbladder (stage 1), the gallbladder wall (stage 2), which was the case with our patient or pericholecystitic tissue (stage 3). CT scan is considered to be the gold standard for the detection of emphysematous cholecystitis. However, due to the insidious onset of the clinical picture, the use of this technique is often delayed during the first few hours [4].

She progressed to septic shock with multiorganic dysfunction. A Computed Tomography (CT) was performed.","Abdominal and pelvic CT depicted a duodenal neoformative thickening (third portion) and parietal discontinuity, suggesting rupture, confirmed by a subsequent CT with oral contrast (Fig. 1). A fistulous tract, opacified by the oral contrast, lead to a paravertebral collection (L2-L4), with gas, measuring 70mm of maximum diameter, surrounding the infrarenal aorta (Fig. 2). We could also see the oral contrast extending to the intervertebral spaces and anterior epidural space/medullary canal. There were signs of previous vertebroplasty at L2-L3 (Fig. 3).Peri-pancreatic lymphadenopathy and?moderate free fluid were noted (Fig. 4).There was also an unremarkable bilateral pleural effusion and global cardiomegaly (Fig. 5).

The patient died 10 days after surgery.","Spondylodiscitis refers to an infection of the intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies, with high morbidity and mortality. Immunosuppression, diabetes, alcoholism, drug addiction, recent surgical history and spinal trauma are the main risk factors. [1]The infection can reach the spine by multiple arteries (vertebral or lumbar arteries), veins (Batson venous plexus), by contiguity (secondary to an adjacent abscess) or direct inoculation (accidental or iatrogenic). [2]Blood cultures are essential but not sufficient in 50 to 75% of the cases and a biopsy is recommended. [1, 4]The most frequent pyogenic organisms involved areStaphylococcus aureus(60% of cases) andEnterobacter species(30%). [1]The Streptococcus anginosus(formerlyStreptococcus milleri), which was found on our patient��s blood cultures, belongs to the anginosus group, that usually exist inside the paranasal sinuses, oropharynx, gastrointestinal and vaginal tract. [3]Due to this, we first excluded an ORL origin to the infection by an ENT. The following abdominopelvic CT revealed a neoformative duodenal mass with a fistulous tract to the intervertebral spaces as the cause of the spondylodiscitis and the haematogeneous infection.CT plays an important role in these cases, allowing evaluation of the intervertebral disc, and characterises epidural involvement (epiduritis/epidural abscess), which may lead to compression of the dural sac and nerve roots. [5] When accompanied by gas at the intervertebral spaces, iatrogenesis by recent interventions or a fistulous tract should be considered, as occurred in our case.Conventional radiography is insensitive for the first 2-4 weeks.MRI is the imaging of choice for evaluation, depicting inflammation of the vertebral endplates and peri-vertebral/epidural soft tissues, with focal hyperintensity of the intervertebral disc in T2-weighted image (WI), and a variable enhancement in T1-WI post-contrast.?Due to the rapidly progressive course, we were not able to perform an MRI in our patient.Treatment of choice is intravenous antibiotics accordingly to the pathogen sensitivity. Surgical intervention may be required (in cases secondary to other conditions).The follow-up depends on the clinical response: if good response, X-rays may suffice. MRI is required if a complication is suspected. Systematic MRI is not necessary (no correlation with the clinical improvement).[6]The radiologist plays an important role in making the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis and determining the source of infection, namely in rarer cases of abscess contiguity.Written informed patient consent for publication has been obtained.",Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforationPyogenic spondylodiscitis (Streptococcus anginosus) due to intestinal perforationIatrogenic spondylodiscitis (due to previous vertebroplasty)Tuberculous spondylodiscitisFungal spondylodiscitis,Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation,10,16686;16622;12133;10986;10096,"Area of InterestAbdomen,  Musculoskeletal spine,  Small bowel  ;Imaging TechniqueCTNo Procedure;Special FocusAbscess,  Infection;",title(final_diagnosis),580,Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation,"{""A"": ""Fungal spondylodiscitis"", ""B"": ""Iatrogenic spondylodiscitis (due to previous vertebroplasty)"", ""C"": ""Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation"", ""D"": ""Pyogenic spondylodiscitis (Streptococcus anginosus) due to intestinal perforation"", ""E"": ""Tuberculous spondylodiscitis""}",C,Streptococcus anginosus spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation,D,C,"[""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/ncFIV3lm.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/sMk6VIPh.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/6ASk8agW.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/58zlA8Dc.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/LoJ8RZHU.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/5766QvMp.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/0fUthtqp.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/vQBziA-W.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/WjkbcPwN.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Streptococcus anginosus Spondylodiscitis due to intestinal perforation/wwpS_zsp.jpg""]","[""CT acquisition on the axial plane after intravenous contrast administration, depicting duodenal wall thickening and discontinuity (arrow), suggestive of a rupture."", ""CT acquisition on the axial plane complemented with oral contrast, confirms the intestinal rupture with oral contrast extravasation to the paravertebral abscess collection (arrow)."", ""CT acquisition after contrast administration on the axial plane, depicting the paravertebral abscess collection with endoluminal gas surrounding the aorta (arrows)."", ""CT reconstruction in the coronal plane depicting the collection with an infrarenal longitudinal extension along both sides of the aorta (arrows)."", ""CT reconstruction on the sagittal plane, depicting extension of the collection to the intervertebral spaces and anterior epidural space/medullary canal (arrows)."", ""CT reconstruction on the sagittal plane, after oral contrast administration, confirms the presence of a communication between the paravertebral collection and the intervertebral spaces (arrow)."", ""CT reconstruction on the sagittal plane, depicting coexisting changes compatible with previous L2 and L3 vertebroplasty (arrows)."", ""CT acquisition after contrast administration on the axial plane, depicting multiple peri-pancreatic adenopathies (arrow)."", ""CT reconstruction in the coronal plane, depicting multiple peri-pancreatic adenopathies (arrow) and a moderate amount of dispersed free fluid."", ""CT acquisition on the axial plane depicting mild bilateral pleural effusion, more pronounced at the right hemithorax, with passive bilateral lung atelectasis.

Case number 16760,2020/5/28,https://www.eurorad.org/case/16760,"60-year old female patient, non-smoker, was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology with left parotid gland tumour. The lesion was incidentally found during thyroid ultrasound (surveillance due to hypothyroidism). The patient was asymptomatic.","The lesion was reported on ultrasound as solid, hypoechoic and hypervascular. Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAC) was inconclusive due to the scarce amount of acquired material, however, no signs of atypia were found. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was thus requested by the referring physician. The examination confirmed the presence of an ovoid, well-marginated lesion in the deep lobe of the left parotid gland, measuring 8x11x16mm. The tumour was heterogeneous, predominantly hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1-WI), hyperintense on T2-WI and fat-saturated T2-WI (Figs. 1a-c). Signs of restriction of diffusion were present with Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) value of1.0x10-3mm2/sec(Figs. 2a,b). Lesion enhanced vividly and on the basis of dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence type""b��Time-intensity Curve (TiC) was obtained (Fig. 3). No signs of facial nerve involvement or perineurial spread were noted. Regional lymph nodes were not enlarged.","Imaging findings combined with anamnesis and physical examination seemed to be indicative of a Warthin Tumor. The patient was scheduled for elective parotidectomy - superficial lobe of the gland and a solitary nodule within the deep lobe was removed, the function of the facial nerve was preserved. However, the postoperative histopathological report brought an unexpected diagnosis of salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) with a prominent lymphoid infiltrate of the stroma. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second surgery in order to obtain wide margins and radiation. Post-operative second look evaluation of MRI did not differ from the first impression.AciCC is a slowly-growing, 3rd most frequent primary parotid malignancy with a prevalence in women [1]. It may be multicentric and bilateral. The prognosis is generally favourable (80%10-yr survival), however, local recurrence may be seen in up to 35% and distant metastases can be found in lungs and bones [1].Differentiation between malignant and benign lesions is of the utmost importance in reference to treatment planning. Local excision or superficial parotidectomy is usually sufficient in benign lesions, total parotidectomy with risk of injury to the facial nerve is required in malignancy [2]. Clinical findings often show limited value with a few indicators of malignancy (e.g. facial nerve palsy). FNAC is inconclusive in up to 5% of the cases [3-6]. MRI is well established in detecting parotid gland tumours. The analysis of conventional sequences with DWI and DCE-MRI allows to differentiate various types of parotid tumours [7,8,9] with increasing diagnostic accuracy, however, some of the features may overlap between histologies. Radiological signs of malignancy include indistinct margins, involvement of nerves and/or lymphadenopathy. The well-defined lesion is usually benign. Analysis of DCE-MRI is based on an assessment of time-signal intensity curves obtained by placing regions of interest (ROIs) over the lesion [8,9,10] - Fig. 4. Estimationof ADC thresholds derived from the receiver operating characteristic curves remains a subject to research [8,11,12,13]. Yabuuchi et al. suggested thresholds of 1.4x10-3mm2/secto differentiate pleomorphic adenomas from carcinomas and 1.0x10-3mm2/secbetween Warthin Tumors and carcinomas [11].Take-home messages:1.

Case number 17930,2022/11/29,https://www.eurorad.org/case/17930,A 53-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department because of a 24-hour history of right flank pain.No fever or vomiting was described. Abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with positive Blumberg sign.The only laboratory abnormality was a mild elevation of C Reactive Protein.,"Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an enlarged appendix (2 cm diameter, short axis) with irregular wall thickening and diffuse stranding of the adjacent mesenteric fat.Mild ascites in the right paracolic gutter and 2-3 small pericecallymph nodeswere also noted.No pneumoperitoneum or other small bowel or colonic abnormality were seen.","The patient was submitted to an appendicectomy with symptomatic resolution. The macroscopic features of the appendix were also consistent with an acute appendicitis, according to the surgeons. However, ??the final histopathological diagnosis,apart from inflammatory findings,was well-differentiated nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendixstage III (pT3 pN1a).Appendiceal neoplasms are uncommon tumours found in approximately 1% of appendicectomy specimens. Approximately 30%�C50% of these tumours will manifest acutely mimicking a typical appendicitis [1].Sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is generally above 90% in most published series, and CT is now commonly performed especially in adult patients and atypical presentations. Preoperative detection of appendiceal neoplasms is important because it may result in change not only in the surgical approach (ie, laparoscopic vs open surgery) but also in the appropriate procedure (ie, appendectomy vs right hemicolectomy) [2].Red flags on CT that help in differentiating underlying appendiceal neoplasm from appendicitis are: appendiceal diameter of >15mm, associated soft-tissue mass, wall-thickening and irregularity [3].The majority of appendiceal masses consist of primary epithelial neoplasms, being the epithelial adenocarcinoma the most common malignant neoplasm of the appendix, with mucinous and nonmucinous histologic types occurring in 37% and 27% of cases, respectively [4].In our case the histopathological diagnosis was nonmucinous (colonic-type) adenocarcinoma of the appendix.Characteristic imaging features of these neoplasms include a focal soft-tissue mass or subtle soft-tissue infiltration of the entire appendix, without mucocele formation. Periappendiceal fat stranding is common and may be due to extension of the primary tumour and/or superimposed appendicitis. Cross-sectional evaluation usually demonstrates direct invasion of the adjacent organs, regional and distant lymphadenopathy, and metastatic disease [2].Right hemicolectomy is considered the standard of care, and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy is also indicated in node-positive disease [5],as happened in our case: a right hemicolectomy was eventually performed, and treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabin was initiated.Patients should undergo colonoscopy to evaluate for synchronous colorectal tumours. Alsoto assess whether the tumour displays the characteristic molecular features of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, the expression of mismatch-repair (MMR) proteins and microsatellite instability (MSI) status must be investigated [6]. Our patient presented loss of MSH2/MSH6 expression.Teaching points:Imaging findings may overlap with those of acute appendicitis.Features that should alert the radiologist to the presence of an underlying neoplasm arediameter of >15mm,irregular wall thickening of the appendix, enhancing soft-tissue nodularity, infiltration, or a mass.Written informed patient consent for publication has been obtained.",Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendixAppendicitisMucocele of the appendixCaecal diverticulitisAppendiceal tumour,Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix,5,18374;18338;18330;18136;18135;18084;18024;18017;17967;17958;17932;17930;17941;17891;17730;17714;17687;17556;17528;17501;17478;17406;17374;17336;17310;17265;17167;17151;17150;17148;17058;17044;17034;17033;17014;16863;16860;16818;16817;16803;16748;16652;16572;16539;16516;16458;16446;16445;16418;16400;16362;16290;16160;16239;16166;15991;15983;15806;15860;15502;15782;15684;15734;15692;15660;15086;15580;15388;15420;15295;15227;15234;15034;15104;14970;14947;14606;14878;14714;14495;14426;14086;14321;14152;14308;13937;13943;14150;14189;14131;14154;14087;14064;13885;13661;13962;13936;13938;13784;13757;13756;13660;13676;13253;13509;13518;13535;13523;13334;13453;13354;13321;13378;13312;13314;13268;13180;12960;13067;12679;13042;12855;12970;12994;13003;12913;12876;12815;12782;12669;12710;12591;12642;12483;12402;11091;12256;12277;12199;12297;12115;12024;12051;11987;11431;11975;11885;11448;11741;11591;11713;11665;11490;11495;11597;11498;11557;11543;11533;11458;11456;11445;11466;11409;11298;10993;11268;11248;11096;11198;11050;11159;11172;11145;11027;10998;10945;11001;10960;10781;10975;10804;10934;10825;10807;10713;10740;10843;10816;10789;10405;10746;10472;10644;10669;10629;10596;10587;10485;10479;10468;10217;10446;10397;10324;10400;10338;10310;10258;10211;10209;10073;9921;10152;10038;10051;10028;9728;9966;9841;9976;9929;9822;9800;9832;9729;8966;9621;9555;9537;9516;9453;9403;9176;9291;9300;9116;9088;9029;8899,"Area of InterestAbdomen,  Gastrointestinal tract,  Oncology  ;Imaging TechniqueCTNo Procedure;Special FocusAcute,  Cancer,  Neoplasia;",clinical_history,648,Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis,"{""A"": ""Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix"", ""B"": ""Appendiceal tumour"", ""C"": ""Caecal diverticulitis"", ""D"": ""Mucocele of the appendix"", ""E"": ""Appendicitis""}",A,Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix,C,A,"[""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/a4UheKSt.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/QAU2brxb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/v_MOnD7F.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/3TA78fqs.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix: An uncommon cause of appendicitis/FTwGhb_4.jpg""]","[""Contrast-enhanced transverse CT scan shows irregular circumferential wall thickening and dilatation of the appendix (red arrow: maximal appendiceal diameter 2 cm) arrow.

Case number 9232,2011/6/19,https://www.eurorad.org/case/9232,"2-year-old patient came to our attention for acute right-leg pain, palpable muscle thickening and walking impairment due to painful leg press-up referred after a mild effort.There was no significant clinical history.","On admission, plain film revealed cortical bone sclerosis of right femoral diaphysis (Fig.1). Ultrasound showed an inhomogeneous mass, 8x3 cm on maximum diameter, placed into the deep muscle-layer of the thigh (Fig.2a,b). Lesion appeared well defined, quite squeezable using the US-convex probe with clear colour Doppler signals (Fig.2c,d). MR examination was performed: lesion appeared isointense in SE T1W images (Fig.3a), inhomogeneously hyperintense on STIR sequences (Fig.3b,c) with multiple signal-void areas on FFE T2W sequences (Fig.3d), after paramagnetic cm iv-administration a significant inhomogeneous enhancement was also achieved. Moreover, the involved muscle appeared replaced by the lesion rather than really compressed (Fig.3e,f). CT examination showed the diffuse cortical bone thickening better without any appreciable cortical breaks (Fig.4).Based on these findings, differential diagnosis of mesenchimal sarcoma could not be excluded, for this reason surgical biopsy was performed. Finally, artero-venous malformation was confirmed on histologic evaluation (Fig.5).","The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification, based on cellular features, subdivides vascular anomalies in vascular tumours and vascular malformations (simple or combined). Jackson et al classify haemangiomas, vascular malformations, and lymphatic malformations on the basis of vascular dynamics. Malformations with arterial components are considered high-flow lesions and those without arterial components are considered low-flow lesions.US is an essential, noninvasive tool used to examine superficial vascular lesions. Colour Doppler imaging permits analysis of arterial and venous flow and measurement of flow velocities, it also results in an important method for monitoring patients who have undergone therapy, but it is limited in the assessment of deep lesions and lesions adjacent to interfering air or bone.CT with iv cm-administration is useful for assessment of vascular malformations; to estimate the presence of calcification or thrombus, distal runoff (when lesions are located in the extremities) and concomitant lesions. Because CT involves considerable exposure to ionising radiation and provides less information about blood flow, MR imaging has replaced CT in the evaluation of vascular malformations.MR imaging is the most valuable modality for the classification of vascular malformations. It depicts the anatomic relations between the vascular lesion and adjacent organs. Slow-flow venous malformations have high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas high-flow arteriovenous malformations and fistulas contain a signal void. Phleboliths and calcifications also show signal voids in all image sequences. Dynamic study with a gradient pulse sequence is useful for evaluating the flow velocity (slow, intermediate, or high) of lesions and in monitoring patients who have undergone therapy.",High-flow venous malformation of the right thighHaemangioma / other high-flow vascular malformationsLow-flow vascular malformationsFibrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcomaHaemangioendothelioma / angiosarcomaEwing\'s Sarcoma,High-flow venous malformation of the right thigh,14,15459;15366;14915;14500;13683;13516;13073;13058;12678;12652;12583;12210;11408;10533;9942;9232,"Area of InterestMusculoskeletal soft tissue,  Extremities,  Musculoskeletal bone  ;Imaging TechniqueDigital radiography,  Ultrasound,  Ultrasound-Colour Doppler,  MR,  CTProcedureDiagnostic procedure,  Computer Applications-Detection, diagnosis,  Biopsy;No Special Focus;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,705,Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation,"{""A"": ""Haemangioma / other high-flow vascular malformations"", ""B"": ""Low-flow vascular malformations"", ""C"": ""Fibrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma"", ""D"": ""Ewing\\'s Sarcoma"", ""E"": ""High-flow venous malformation of the right thigh""}",E,High-flow venous malformation of the right thigh,B,E,"[""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/AyQ5ZO76.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/8PEqhOwd.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/QflBuFg7.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/8OpB2Pz5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/o8B7qjj1.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/X8u7goYM.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/QAzaMjlR.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/fQ8qh-Xg.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/Xt3nP9Cz.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/1A4M4YL7.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/as6bLr8B.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/gao3v05G.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/WQyQT0Ql.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Childhood lower extremity vascular malformation/qb68gr8P.jpg""]","[""Longitudinal scan: picture shows an hypoechoic and well defined mass, along the deep muscle layers, closed to the proximal femoral diaphysis."", ""Axial scan showing the hypoechoic mass anteriorly to the femoral bone."", ""Long-axis scan: colour Doppler scan shows a significant intralesional vascular flow, with multiple vascular-sinues filling aspect\n(signal has been acquired using high-flow vascular presetting)."", ""Axial colour Doppler scan confirms the same findings."", ""Microscopic findings: photo well defines the arterovenous anomalous channels - with some blood-clots inside the lumen - surrounded by lipidic and muscle tissue."", ""SE T1W sequence: picture shows the isointesity lesion (when compared to adjacent muscle signal), scattered by irregular hyperintensity signal spots."", ""Axial STIR sequence:  inhomogeneous aspect of the lesion with widely hypointense areas surrounded by high-signal intensity tissue."", ""Coronal STIR sequence also shows the hypointensity cortical bone thickening (due to sclerosis by compressive effect of surrounding lesion) and hyperintensity signal by bone-marrow oedema."", ""After iv cm-administration, axial SPIR T1W sequence.

Case number 9435,2011/7/8,https://www.eurorad.org/case/9435,"An 11-year-old boy who lived on a farm presented with a 2-week history of fever, vomiting and pain in the right hip that extended into the right buttock. The patient was non-weight bearing on the right leg, with restricted movement of the right hip. CRP was elevated.","The pelvic radiograph (Fig. 1) at presentation was normal. Clinical examination had revealed tenderness on deep palpation of the right iliac fossa, and an abdominal ultrasound obtained to exclude appendicitis was negative. No hip joint effusion was seen on ultrasound. A MRI examination (Fig. 2) was requested. Axial and coronal STIR and T2w images showed a focal lesion with surrounding high signal in the right sacral alum and less well-defined high signal in the right iliac bone also. The sacral lesion was associated with cortical loss at the inferior aspect of the right sacroiliac joint and a low signal (all sequences) central bony sequestrum. The adjacent iliacus, pectineus, obturator internus, psoas and gluteus maximus muscles were thickened and of high signal. There was marked enhancement post-gadolinium of the bony sacral lesion and the anterior soft tissue collection. A subsequent limited-range CT examination (Fig. 3) showed the sacral abnormalities in more detail.","The patient was commenced on IV antibiotics, which are to continue for 12-weeks. The orthopaedic team opted to treat empirically rather than perform a biopsy, as following the CT examination, it was deemed un-necessarily difficult to safely biopsy the sacrum. Within 48 hours, the patient��s symptoms had lessened and his inflammatory markers had decreased.The annual incidence of septic arthritis is 5.2 �C 12/100 000 and pyogenic sacroiliitis accounts for 1-2% of cases [1]. Sacral osteomyelitis is rare and diagnosis is often delayed due to a variable clinical presentation, low suspicion of examining clinician, lack of awareness of diagnostic procedure, and rare findings on plain radiographs. The rate of complications increases with delay in diagnosis, and includes abscess or sequestrum formation, prolonged period of sepsis, long-term joint deformity, disability or even death [2].Presentation is often a triad of fever, low back pain and difficulty weight-bearing, associated with an elevated C-reactive protein. The most common causative agent is Staphlococcus aureus, and a study by Wu et al 2007 [2] found positive blood cultures in 80% of paediatric patients, with a high rate of synovial aspirate culture. One in three patients in this study had a concurrent infection, with the urinary tract the most common site. Brucellosis and other atypical organisms are associated with sacral osteomyelitis.The plain radiograph is rarely helpful. An ultrasound examination is useful to exclude a hip joint effusion. Tc99-MDP bone scan is a sensitive test, but lacks specificity. CT clearly shows bone and soft tissue involvement, and may have a role in aspiration or biopsy. MRI has emerged as the imaging modality of choice due to its increased sensitivity and specificity [3, 4]. MRI is sensitive for bone marrow change but there is debate in the literature as to whether osteomyelitis can be differentiated from sacroiliitis [5]. It has been suggested that the presence of subperiosteal infiltrates or transcapsular infiltration of the juxta-articular muscle layers is a specific finding of sacroiliitis due to a septic osteomyelitis rather than spondyloarthropathy [3].Crohn's disease is associated with musculoskeletal complications with psoas and gluteal muscle abscesses, abdominal wall fistulae and sacral osteomyelitis, all described [6]. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis is an inflammatory form of osteomyelitis, and although it is rare and the sacrum an uncommon site, it is a condition to be considered in adolescent patients presenting with osteomyelitis, in order to prevent prolonged ineffective antibiotic therapy and inappropriate surgery [7].",Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis.Pyogenic osteomyelitis - Staphylococcus aureusBrucellosisTB and other atypical organismsInflammatory causes - Inflammatory bowel diseaseChronic recurrent multi-focal osteomyelitis and systemic sclerosisIatrogenic causes - recent instrumentation or surgery to the back or spineGenitourinary tract or abdomen and pelvisSickle cell disease,Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis.,7,9435,"Area of InterestPelvis  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  MRNo Procedure;Special FocusInfection;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,720,Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis,"{""A"": ""Brucellosis"", ""B"": ""Pyogenic osteomyelitis - Staphylococcus aureus"", ""C"": ""Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis."", ""D"": ""Genitourinary tract or abdomen and pelvis"", ""E"": ""Sickle cell disease""}",C,Sacral osteomyelitis with associated pyogenic sacral osteomyelitis.,B,C,"[""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/J1Qxu-tO.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/PzTyQsRJ.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/R6WYhjWw.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/a-Cfsgnb.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/JJypxfcY.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/uNULj4MN.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Sacral osteomyelitis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis/PWuPP3QU.jpg""]","[""AP radiograph of the pelvis.

Case number 9905,2012/2/2,https://www.eurorad.org/case/9905,"A 66-year-old woman with previous thyroidectomy for follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland presented with a painless swelling in the right cheek, gradually growing in size over the previous two months. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass with no associated skin changes or superficial lesions. No neck nodes were palpable.","An orthopantomography showed a large expansive lesion in the right side of the mandible with lytic characteristics.A head and neck CT without contrast medium (Fig. 1) showed a 4 x 5.5 cm mass lesion situated in the right masticatory space, originating from the posterior mandibular ramus. The mass was cystic with a unilocular pattern and scalloped borders associated with thinning and defects of the bone cortex.An MRI with contrast medium (Fig. 2) was performed in order to better evaluate the morphology of the lesion. The lesion showed a high signal intensity in T2 weighted sequences and low signal intensity in T1 weighted sequences, due to fluid content. It had a cyst-like appearance with an enhancing peripheral rim showing an intramural enhancing soft tissue nodule on the medial aspect of the cystic wall.","Ameloblastoma is an odontogenic tumour thought to originate from central mandibular or maxillary odontogenic epithelium [1, 2]. It represents about 1% of oral tumours and is the most common odontogenic tumour (35%). Its peak incidence is in the 3rd-4th decades, while other cystic lesions of the mandible and maxilla (e.g. aneurismal bone cyst) are more common during childhood [3]. Similar to dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts it most commonly occurs in the mandible (80%), particulary in the posterior mandibular ramus [1, 4]. There are several histological sub-types, however, radiologically we are not able to distinguish them all [2, 5].The tumour is often clinically asymptomatic and slow-growing. In most cases it is histologically benign, but can be locally aggressive with increased risk of local recurrence if not adequately treated (estimated recurrence rate 33%). Late signs include loose teeth and bleeding. It is often associated with an unerupted 3rd molar and in most cases >2 cm in size at diagnosis. Malignant transformation is rare (1%).Radiologically we can classify them in 3 groups: peripheral, unicystic and multicystic. The multicystic type is the most common (86%), with various cysts grouped together or separated by osseous septa [1, 4]. The most relevant diagnostic pattern is a ��bubbly��, multilocular, mixed cystic-solid mass. In these multicystic cases it is easier to distinguish between ameloblastoma and odontogenic cystic abnormalities (example dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts) which often present as unilocular cystic lesions. In cases of unicystic ameloblastomas this distinction is harder. Contrast-enhanced CT (and MRI) could show either small contrast-enhancing nodular lesions within the cystic wall or larger lesions with surrounding soft-tissue enhancement mixed with cystic areas. These enhancing nodules are an important feature for differential diagnosis, particularly with dentigerous cysts when also associated with an unerupted 3rd molar. MRI is indicated to assess involvement of neurovascular structures and extraosseous components, even though they are rare. T1-weighted images show a mixed signal intensity or typical low signal intensity. T2-weigthed images usually show high signal intensity due to fluid content. MRI is useful for differential diagnosis with odontogenic keratocysts since fluid content of odontogenic keratocysts is more proteinacious and viscous, and therefore does not show such a high signal intensity [6]. Differential diagnosis between larger dentigerous cysts, odontogenic keratocysts and unicystic ameloblastoma may be difficult, and sometimes can only be confirmed histologicaly [6].Complete surgical excision is indicated for small lesions while en bloc removal is recommended for larger ones [1, 7].",AmeloblastomaMetastatic lesion of follicular carcinoma of the thyroid glandDentigerous cystOdontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumour)Aneurysmal bone cystAmeloblastoma,Ameloblastoma,9,9905,"Area of InterestHead and neck  ;Imaging TechniqueCT,  MRProcedureStaging;Special FocusCysts;",clinical_history+imaging_findings,747,Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day),"{""A"": ""Odontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumour)"", ""B"": ""Ameloblastoma"", ""C"": ""Ameloblastoma"", ""D"": ""Dentigerous cyst"", ""E"": ""Metastatic lesion of follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland""}",B,Ameloblastoma,E,B,"[""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/qE9Q-up4.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/7q2yRXPG.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/CAmss2yr.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/Do43a-79.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/UjH0t5Im.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/ALxHPjJ0.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/5e-c5-37.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/lr9qv1J5.jpg"", ""EURORAD/Painless swelling in the right cheek (ECR 2011 Case of the Day)/eKAIjcma.jpg""]","[""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial CT images of the mandible"", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Axial MRI- VIBE after administration of contrast medium."", ""Coronal MRI T2-weighted image.""]"
