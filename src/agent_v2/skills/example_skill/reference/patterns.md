# Common Code Patterns Reference

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Creates objects without specifying exact class. Like ordering "a coffee" vs specifying every detail.

### Singleton Pattern
Ensures only one instance exists. Like having one CEO per company.

### Builder Pattern
Constructs complex objects step by step. Like customizing a pizza with toppings.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
Makes incompatible interfaces work together. Like a power adapter for foreign outlets.

### Decorator Pattern
Adds behavior to objects dynamically. Like adding toppings to ice cream.

### Facade Pattern
Provides simple interface to complex system. Like a TV remote controlling many components.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Observer Pattern
Objects get notified of changes. Like subscribing to a YouTube channel.

### Strategy Pattern
Swaps algorithms at runtime. Like choosing different routes on GPS.

### Iterator Pattern
Traverses collections without exposing internals. Like a playlist's "next" button.
