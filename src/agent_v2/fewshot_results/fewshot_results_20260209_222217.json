Imaging shows an avidly enhancing pineal mass. Germinomas are common in pineal region in males, typically show homogeneous enhancement and are highly radiosensitive. Dermoid would show fat; tectal glioma is usually nonenhancing/indolent; pineoblastoma occurs in children and is heterogeneous/aggressive; meningioma less likely in this location.",
