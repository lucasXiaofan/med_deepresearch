Desmoid tumors (C) are typically solid and infiltrative. Liposarcoma (A) is rare in children and usually shows fatty components on MRI. Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) is a broad category that includes various retroperitoneal sarcomas (like synovial sarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma) which can present as large heterogenous masses with cystic/necrotic areas.

Key features include low signal intensity on both T1-weighted (Image 1) and T2-weighted (Image 2) images, which is characteristic of Giant Cell Tumor of the Tendon Sheath (GCTTS) due to hemosiderin deposition (blooming on susceptibility sequences, though not explicitly shown here, the T2 hypointensity is highly suggestive). Image 3 and 4 show heterogeneous enhancement, and Image 6 shows susceptibility-related signal drop or low SI typical of GCTTS/PVNS family. Compared to reference cases (18540, 885, 1066), the location and signal characteristics (low T1/T2) strongly favor GCTTS over fibroma (which usually has even lower T2 signal and less enhancement) or ganglion cyst (which would be T2 hyperintense).",
