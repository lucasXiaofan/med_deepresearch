While carcinoma is more common, the specific 'bulky' appearance with significant lymphadenopathy and the preserved lumen (not highly stenotic despite wall thickness) often favors lymphoma. However, in the context of obstructive jaundice and CA 19.9, carcinoma is a strong clinical contender. Re-evaluating the image findings: the wall thickening is extremely thick and somewhat homogeneous, which is characteristic of duodenal lymphoma ('aneurysmal' dilation can occur in lymphoma). However, standard clinical practice often yields 'Carcinoma' for such presentations. Let's look closer at the image 3: the duodenal lumen is quite large despite the massive wall thickening, a classic sign of lymphoma (aneurysmal dilatation).
