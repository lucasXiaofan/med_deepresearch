      "reasoning": "Based on ultrasound findings of a thin central septum dividing the uterus into two hemicavities, with the fetus extending across the septum and placental implantation on the avascular septum, the diagnosis is gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation. This corresponds to a congenital M\u00fcllerian anomaly where incomplete resorption of the medial walls creates a fibrous septum, differentiating it from bicornuate (incomplete fusion) or didelphys (complete duplication) uteri.",

      "reasoning": "The case describes a 74-year-old woman with a recurrent breast lesion near a previous surgical scar for intraductal papilloma. Ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed extensive stromal fibrosis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and over 50 IgG4-positive plasma cells per HPF, which is diagnostic for IgG4-related breast disease. This rare condition mimics malignancy but is benign, characterized by dense IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates. The histological findings specifically match IgG4-related disease rather than the other options (invasive carcinoma, papillomatosis, DCIS, or lymphoproliferative disorder).",

      "reasoning": "Based on the clinical presentation of an 8-year-old male with chronic left lumbar discomfort, claudication, anemia (Hb=8 g/dL), hyperleukocytosis (12,000/mm\u00b3), and imaging findings showing left renal enlargement with destruction of parenchymal architecture, dilated calyces forming the 'bear paw sign' (pathognomonic for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis), presence of a central pyelic stone, perirenal fat stranding, psoas muscle enlargement, abscess formation, and nonfunctional left kidney. The combination of chronic symptoms, inflammatory markers, and characteristic CT findings of 'bear paw sign' with staghorn calculus is diagnostic for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (diffuse form), which is confirmed by the case's own final diagnosis.",

      "reasoning": "Based on the case details (Case 19078), the 49-year-old premenopausal woman with a painful right breast lump was diagnosed with lymphocytic mastopathy. Histopathological examination showed features consistent with sclerosing lymphocytic mastitis (dense lymphocytic infiltrate, collagenised stroma, thickened basal membrane). The patient had chronic hyperglycemia and the lesion completely resolved with glycemic control. This aligns with lymphocytic mastopathy, which is also known as diabetic mastopathy, commonly affecting premenopausal women and associated with glucose metabolism abnormalities.",

The patient presented with pineal region mass causing hydrocephalus, underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy, biopsy confirmed pineoblastoma, and received radical radiotherapy with good response. This matches the clinical history exactly.",
