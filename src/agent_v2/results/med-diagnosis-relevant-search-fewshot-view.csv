--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient initially presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure including visual disturbance, retinal stasis, paresis of the VIth cranial nerve, and headaches. An MRI examination revealed a pineal mass. The diagnosis of pineoblastoma was established by stereotactic biopsy, and an intraventricular shunt tube was placed. Radiotherapy was applied with a dose of 64Gy. On a 1-year follow-up MRI the tumour revealed changes in the contrast enhancement pattern compared to the initial study. On the 3-year follow-up study, however, diffuse leptomeningeal and ependymal dissemination of the tumour was detected, and the patient died shortly thereafter.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Pineoblastomas are uncommon pineal tumors, which demonstrate rapid growing and poor prognosis. We report the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented  a pineoblastoma with unusual venticular extension.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 14-year-old girl presented with a 6-week history of severe headache. Neurological examination showed bilateral papilledema. Computed tomography revealed a pineal region mass without hydrocephalus. Brain MR imaging was performed 2 months later in a 1.5T scanner with standard technique (T1-weightedimages before and after intravenous contrast administration). It showed a pineal region tumor continuously invading through the tectum into the cerebral aqueduct with the preservation of the adjacent structures. The tumor appeared an iso to hypointense mass on T1-weighted images, a heterogeneous iso to hyperintense mass on T2-weighted images, and a heterogeneously enhanced mass after administration of contrast medium. Histological examination after endoscopic biopsy of the pineal region, confirmed that the tumor was a pineoblastoma. There was evidence of dissemination in the chiasmatic region, but no other localisation in the rest of the central nervous system or any systemic metastatic lesions. Radiotherapy was given to the whole brain and the spinal cord, and magnetic resonance imaging showed  remission of the tumor.

A six-year-old boy presented with headache of two months�� duration and two episodes of vomiting. On examination the child was afebrile and routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Non-contrast sagittal computed tomography (CT) image shows central calcifications within a mildly hyperdense mass lesion involving pineal gland causing proximal hydrocephalus.Plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ill-defined T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense lesion measuring ~ 1.6x1.9x2 cm with perilesional oedema involving the pineal gland, extending into the tectal plate, the posterior aspect of midbrain, pons, medulla, right superior and middle cerebellar peduncles. There was no diffusion restriction. Few foci of blooming on gradient images were seen, which represented calcifications. The lesion was seen to cause significant mass effect on aqueduct of Sylvius resulting in gross dilatation of both lateral and third ventricles (Evans index: 0.53). There was no midline shift.Post-contrast T1 MRI images show avid enhancement of the lesion. There was no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brain.The possibility of CSF seeding necessitates imaging evaluation of the entire neuroaxis.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 7-month-old boy with no family history of malignancy presented with bilateral leucocoria and left eye protrusion. He showed no signs of neurological dysfunction.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The ultrasound examination of the eyeballs showed bilateral mass lesions with calcifications. The MRI showed solid tumour formations in both globes, highly suggestive of bilateral retinoblastoma. Tumours showed fairly homogeneous enhancement after application of the gadolinium contrast medium and dropout of signal intensity on susceptibility-weighted imaging, which suggested calcifications. An 8 mm cyst within the pineal gland with enhancing, partially nodular thickening of the wall was, in the setting of bilateral retinoblastoma, highly suspicious for pineoblastoma. Subsequent MRI examinations during the course of the following 8 months showed significant growth of the pineal cystic formation (increased from 8 mm to 16 mm in diameter).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
An 18-year-old male adolescent presented to our hospital with headache, nausea and vomiting. The physical examination  revealed signs of increased intracranial pressure. The patient was immediately referred to the department of Radiology for CT scan. Prominent obstructive hydrocephalus was found due to a pineal  region hypodense mass. Following MRI demonstrated a heterogeneous tumor with hyperintense areas in the pineal region. Fatty components were spread in the subarachnoid space, third ventricle and the  aqueduct of Sylvius arousing suspicion of tumor rupture. Levels of AFP and bhCG were normal. The patient was treated for hydrocephalus with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt  prior to resection.During the operation, the mass was totally removed. Histological findings proved this tumor to be a mature teratoma, showing three germ cell layers.

A middle-aged, otherwise healthy woman was referred for an MRI of the right knee. She complained of a mass below the knee cap, that she had already noticed a year ago and that had become moderately tender within the last few weeks. A history of trauma was denied.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
MRI showed a 20 x 36 x 37 mm, smoothly marginated mass in the lateral infrapatellar fat pad of the knee with intimate contact to the dorsal surface of the patellar tendon. On T1-weighted images, it appeared isointense to muscle and displayed a concentric, onion-layer-like pattern. On T2-weighted images, it appeared heterogeneously hyperintense, with some oedema in the adjacent subcutaneous fat tissue (Fig. 1a). There were no susceptibility artifacts on gradient echo sequences (Fig. 1b). Contrast medium was not administered. The lesion was surgically excised in toto without prior biopsy. Histology showed a hypocellular tissue with abundant collagen, some hyalinization and slit-like vascular channels. The spindle-shaped cellular components were arranged in fascicles. There were no giant cells or siderophages (Fig. 2). The specimen also included parts of a synovial bursa (probably the deep infrapatellar bursa).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 38-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a three-day history of gradually progressive, intermittent abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting, and reduced bowel movements. His medical history included schizophrenia, well-controlled with antipsychotic medication. He had no prior abdominal surgeries. An abdominal CT with intravenous contrast (portal venous phase) was obtained.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A large fluid-attenuating mass, composed of multiple confluent cystic lesions, was noted in the right lower quadrant and pelvis, extending into the right inguinal canal (Figure 1). The confluent cystic spaces showed internal densities of fluid, imperceptible walls, lobulated margins, and thin, smooth, enhancing septae (Figure 2). The lesion exerted mass effect on the bladder and adjacent small bowel loops (Figures 3a and 3b). Small bowel obstruction was evident, with prominent dilation of the jejunum and multiple ileal loops. A transition point in the pelvis adjacent to the cystic lesion was evident. Twisting of the mesentery with a prominent whirlpool sign was observed (Figure 4).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
We report the case of a 43 year old male patient, admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain. CT and MRI was performed which revealed a cystic lesion. At laparoscopy a cystic, mass in the mesentery of the ileum was removed and turned out to be an abdominal cystic lymphangioma.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 43 years old male patient was referred to our hospital due to acute abdominal pain.  A medical history of appendectomy but no concomitant diseases were known. Physical examination revealed pressure pain of the whole abdomen. No other significant findings were noted. Laboratory data showed high C- reactive protein value of 314 mg/l.  Because of the clinical appearance a perforated diverticulitis was suspected. CT was performed to detect an abscess or inflammatory signs in the intestine.  This study showed a fatty cystic mass with circular contrast enhancement and 5.3 cm x 6.3 cm in size. This lesion was located in the mesentery of the left para-umbilical region and revealed attenuation values of fat (about -15 to -40 Hounsfield units). After intravenous contrast administration a wall enhancement of this lesion could be detected (Fig. 1). MRI confirmed this diagnosis and also revealed a cystic tumour with inflammatory changes in the ambient mesentery. Chemical shift gradient echo detected a central fatty structure in this lesion. The MRI study also showed some liquid components in this mass (Fig. 2,3). A cystic neoplasm of the mesentery was considered.At laparotomy, a soft cystic mass in the mesentery of the ileum with inflammatory changes was found and removed. The tumour was milky fluid-filled and partially adherent to the small bowel. Neither ascites was seen in the peritoneal cavity, nor dilatation nor were inflammatory changes of the intestine or mesentery found.Pathologic examination revealed the diagnosis of mesenteric uniloculated cystic lymphangioma.

A 4-year-old male child came to the Emergency Room with a history of abdominal pain, fever and vomiting since 2 days. Clinical examination revealed tenderness in epigastrium, blood investigations revealed mildly raised serum amylase and elevated total leukocyte count child was sent for ultrasound to look for pancreatitis.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Ultrasound of abdomen revealed a well-defined thick-walled cystic lesion with internal echoes, debris and few calcific foci in its wall, in epigastrium extending to the right hypochondrium. (Figures 1, 3) Perilesional fat stranding and lymphadenopathy were also seen as suggestive of surrounding infection/inflammation (Figure 4) Lesion was in close approximation with second part(D2) of duodenum. (Figure 2)Doppler revealed mild hyperemia of the cyst wall. The pancreas was normal in size and echotexture. ?Diagnosis of infected enteric (duodenal) duplication cyst was given.CT abdomen with contrast was done later which revealed a 3.7 x 3.3 x 4.1 cm thick-walled peripherally enhancing retroperitoneal cyst along the wall of second part of duodenum with no luminal communication and surrounding fat stranding and lymph nodes, confirming the findings of ultrasound. (Figures 5,6) The pancreas was normal in size and attenuation on CTIntra-operative findings: A common wall between cyst and D2 of duodenum was found with no communication between the two.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A pelvic mass with partly solid and cystic morphology was detected at routine ultrasound in the 17th week of pregnancy in a 30-year-old patient. A follow-up after 3 weeks showed increasing size. Meanwhile, the patient had developed acne. Laboratory showed mild excess of androgens. Pelvic MRI was ordered.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Due to complex morphology and limitations in complete assessment of the lesion by sonography, MRI was warranted for further characterisation. MRI displays a well-circumscribed right adnexal mass measuring 13 cm in diameter. The mass is located in the pouch of Douglas and displaces the pregnant uterus superiorly and anteriorly with consecutive mass effect on the bladder (Fig. 1a, b). It shows partly cystic and solid architecture. The solid component displays intermediate SI on T1 and low to intermediate SI on T2 with scattered areas of high SI on T2 (Fig. 2a, b). Due to possible adverse effects on the fetus no IV Gadolinium was applied. The contralateral ovary appears normal, regional lymph nodes are insuspicious and there is no ascites. At the time of the presented case the additional value of DWI in pelvic masses was not yet established and DWI was unavailable.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 17 year old girl was presented with painless abdominal distention. Physical examination revealed a palpable abdominal mass. Laboratory tests were normal.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient was admitted to the hospital with painless abdominal distension and underwent ultrasonographic evaluation, which revealed a large left abdominal mass. The lesion was heterogeneous, mostly solid with a small cystic component, demonstrating prominent vascularity. A CT scan was done, revealing a well circumscribed mass, with 18 x 17 cm, localized predominantly in the left abdomen, originating from the right ovary. This mass was heterogeneous with an irregular shaped central cystic area, a lobulated soft tissue density component and a peripheral left hypodense area. After contrast administration there was enhancement of the central mass (Fig. 1a) and prominent vessels converging to the hilum were evident (Fig. 1b). Increased caliber of right ovarian vessels was also noted (Fig. 1b).On MRI the central mass was moderately hypointense on T1WI (Fig. 2), of intermediate signal intensity on T2WI (Fig. 3 a,b), with an irregular central cystic area. It was surrounded by a smoothly marginated solid component with hypointense capsule on T1WI and T2WI, crossed by several vessels. There was enhancement of the central mass and of the tumour capsule after gadolinium administration (Fig. 4).Surgery was done, with total resection of the mass and partial resection of the right fallopian tube (Fig. 5).The histological diagnosis was Sex Cord Stromal Tumour of Undetermined Pattern of the right ovary, consisting on two distinct components, one external corresponding to a fibrothecoma, and one internal of stromal origin with an undetermined pattern (Fig. 6,7).

A multicystic adnexal mass with a solid component of a mean CT density of 55 HU on CT examination, and very low signal intensity on T2-weighted images on MR imaging examination was detected on a post-menopausal woman.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 64-year old woman was referred for lower abdominal pain and a complex left adnexal mass detected sonographically.Multidetector CT examination (MDCT) of the abdomen revealed the presence of a multicystic left adnexal mass (Figure 1), with a soft-tissue element of 55 HU CT attenuation measurement (Figure 1b, c). Based on MDCT findings, the diagnosis of malignancy was suggested.MR imaging examination of the pelvis was followed. The area interpreted as a soft-tissue component on CT had low and very low signal intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images respectively (Figure 2), suggestive for the presence of fibrous tissue. The same element showed mild, delayed enhancement after gadolinium administration (Figure 2d, e) and restricted diffusion (Figure 3). MR imaging findings suggested the diagnosis of a benign ovarian tumor, containing fibrous tissue.The diagnosis of a borderline ovarian cystadenofibroma was made pathologically (Figure 4).

A 83-year-old man was referred to our institution complaining of painless rectal bleeding and a protruding mass during defecation. Digital rectal examination confirmed a friable soft tissue mass. Clinical history and remainder physical examination were unremarkable. Blood investigation revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was within the normal range.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a solid, homogeneous and hypoechoic tumour in the anorectal junction (Fig.1). Due to the patient's painful, it was not possible to cross the tumour with the probe. The tumour invaded the submucosa, but no muscular invasion or mesorectal lymph node metastases were observed.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed for further characterization and local staging, confirmed a solid polypoid lesion in the anorectal junction. The hypointense line corresponding to muscularis propria was intact and no internal sphincter invasion was observed. The tumour demonstrated high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. On diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) the tumour demonstrated restricted diffusion, represented by high signal intensity on b 1000 s/mm2 and corresponding low signal on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map.

After clinical examination an ultrasound was performed first. B mode US showed a nodular, lobed and hypoechoic right inguinal mass with an approximated size of 55x43x25 mm (Fig. 1 a). US Power Doppler demonstrated hypervascularization (Fig. 1 b). For further characterization an MR was made. MR-T1 weighted images (Fig. 2 a) located an hypointense mass above the psoas muscle, between the iliac-femoral veins and the sartorius muscle. On MR-T2 weighted images (Fig. 2 b) the mass appeared hyperintense. Diffusion WI sequences showed restriction of the water movement that indicated malignancy (Fig. 2 c). After the injection of gadolinium a heterogeneous and centripetal enhancement was demonstrated, suggesting necrotic areas inside the mass (Fig. 2 d). PET-CT indicated hypercaptation of the inguinal lesion without systemic extension (Fig. 3). The histopathological analysis demonstrated a round, small cell sarcoma.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 22 year old woman without relevant medical history presented with dry cough, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath for several days. No fever was noted. On physical examination there were diminished breath sounds on the left side. Laboratory analysis on admission did not show any abnormal findings. Chest radiograph showed massive left-sided pleural effusion, atelectasis of LLL and a left parahilar-retrocardiac mass. Contrast enhanced CT demonstrated a left extrapulmonary paravertebral heterogeneously enhancing mass (3,8 x 2,7 x 6,9 cm) at the level of the sixth to eighth thoracic vertebrae. CT did not reveal any extension into the spinal canal or vertebral bone changes. A pleural chest tube was inserted and drained the left pleural effusion, with significant improvement in patient's dyspnoea.  After a few days a CT-guided core biopsy of the mass was performed and histologic examination showed small and round blue cells with round nuclei, small nucleoli, and scanty cytoplasms were observed that appeared to be well organized. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for CD99, S-100 and vimentin and negative staining for cytokeratins, neurofilament, synaptophysin, and chromogranins. The CD99 was identified by the 013 antibody, which is a useful immunohistochemical marker for Ewing sarcoma (ES). Based on these findings, the mass lesion was diagnosed as extraskeletal Ewing��s sarcoma- primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).The patient received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent a new MRI examination, before surgical excision. On restaging MRI examination, the mass showed significant decrease in its size consistent with partial response of the disease to chemotherapy.

A 58-year-old male with a history of successfully treated melanoma in the right earlobe two years ago, underwent a routine surveillance body computerized tomography (CT) scan. The patient was asymptomatic, and the physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Further evaluation included a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A non-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed a hypodense, well-circumscribed nodule measuring 2.3 cm in the right perirenal space, adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right kidney. After contrast administration, the nodule displayed a hypovascular centre with persistent peripheral enhancement. No intralesional calcifications were noted. A feeding vessel originating from the right renal artery supplied the lesion.On abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the nodule exhibited low signal intensity on the T1-weighted images (T1WI) and very high signal intensity on the T2-weighted images (T2WI). After gadolinium injection, it showed a target-like appearance with a hypointense central area surrounded by an enhancing rim in the arterial phase that persisted in the portal phase. There was no restricted diffusion of water molecules on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and its corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map.The right renal parenchyma showed homogeneous enhancement.There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 74-year-old-male patient underwent abdominal ultrasound for ��on-and-off�� left flank pain. At ultrasound, anill-defined focallesion was detected at the upperpoleof the left kidney, the lesion was slightlyhypoechoicand measured1 cm.He was admitted to the Urological Departmentforfurther evaluation to rule out any underlying malignancy. Laboratory test results did not show any significant abnormalities.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after intravenous contrast administration. AT CT an hypervascular solid nodule was detected, suggestive of a neoplastic lesion.At unenhanced CT the lesion was not identified because isodense to renal parenchyma. After intravenous contrast administration, a solid nodular lesionof 1 centimetre in diameterwas detected at the upper pole of the left kidney.In the early arterial phase, thelesion displayed diffuse and rapid enhancement appearing hypervascular.In the cortico-medullary phase, the lesionremainedmarkedly hyperdense. Inthe parenchymal phase, the lesion showed complete washout andappeared hypodense compared tothe adjacentrenal parenchyma.The lesion margins were well-defined and anteriorlylobulated. A CT suspected diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney was formulated, and the patient was scheduled for left partial nephrectomy.The CT final diagnosis was suggestive of a neoplastic lesion. The patient underwent uneventful transperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. There were no postoperative complications, and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The final diagnosis based on histological examination was of a renal anastomosing haemangioma. At histology, the lesion was characterized by the presence of a sinusoidal-like pattern with occasional hyaline microthrombi and absence of cytological atypia or infiltration. Retrospectively, at CT the lesion appeared always isodense to the blood pool in all the contrast graphic phases.

Non-contrast ultrasound was performed where a heterogeneous echogenic mass was found.Computed tomography (CT) revealed hypo-dense large mass (11 x 9 cm) with some coarse calcifications in the left hepatic lobe and IV-segment with well-defined borders causing mass effect (Fig. 1).Contrast material�Cenhanced CT showed a peripheral nodular enhancement that progressively filled the lesion with progressive centripetal enhancement (Fig. 2, 3 and 4).Due to the portal-artery shunts inside the tumour, in the arterial phase a portal retrograde filling can be appreciated (Fig. 2).Uniform enhancement was shown in venous phase (Fig. 4).Preoperative embolization of the mass was performed.A pigtail catheter was introduced into the aorta. Contrast material was injected and the left gastric and left hepatic arteries that fed the mass where displayed. Embolisation was performed with polyvinyl alcohol spherical particles (900-1200 microns) (Fig. 5, 6 and 7).Seven days later the surgeons informed us that the tumour was completely devascularized.

Recent visit to Macedonia. He was dehydrated, lethargic, pale, peritonitic, with drawing up of his legs. Intussusception was suspected.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A plain radiograph demonstrated an abdominal soft tissue mass centred to the right of midline,  without markedly dilated bowel loops. This was considered indeterminate. Ultrasound demonstrated a large volume of peritoneal free fluid,  and a mass in the right flank,  comprising alternating sonolucent and hyperechoic layers. It was eccentric in shape. Findings appeared atypical for ileocolic intussusception. After clinical discussion,  a diagnostic air enema was performed. Air passed rapidly through colon into distal small bowel,  excluding ileocolic intussusception. Repeat ultrasound confirmed that the mass persisted, unchanged in appearance. It had a right-sided neck, which was shown on ultrasound to connect to small bowel. Hyperechoic mesenteric fat,  and prominent mesenteric lymph nodes were also noted.A Meckel's diverticulum was resected in theatre,  and confirmed pathologically.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Elderly male patient with history of ischaemic heart disease and previous cholecystectomy complained of constipation for the past few weeks with occasional bloody stools. Laboratory assays revealed anaemia (haemoglobin 9.5 g/dl).Colonoscopy showed impassable, easily bleeding stricturing carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Despite upstream faecal residues, water-enema CT-colonography (Fig. 1) well depicted a 6-cm stricturing sigmoid colon tumour, with liver metastases. Consultation between oncologist and surgeons opted for postponing resection after neoadjvant chemotherapy. Meanwhile, to relieve bowel obstruction, improve clinical conditions and prevent perforation, a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) was positioned endoscopically under radiologic guidance (Fig. 2) through the malignant stricture.Afterwards, bowel movement normalized, haemoglobin levels started to increase, and the patient underwent his first chemotherapy.One month later the patient experienced evacuation of the SEMS with stools, confirmed radiographically (Fig. 3), without pain and haemorrhage.Without the SEMS, the patient received three additional chemotherapy cycles during 3 months, until he suffered from acute abdominal pain and vomiting. Radiographic (Fig. 4) and CT (Fig. 5) findings showed pneumoperitoneum consistent with visceral perforation, despite decreased tumour size. Urgent laparotomic surgery, including sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann colostomy (Fig. 6), confirmed perforation in the site of the transmural pT3N1 sigmoid adenocarcinoma.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 54-year-old female patient with known ulcerative colitis, currently undergoing medical treatment, was referred for radiological investigation and colorectal cancer screening, following incomplete follow-up optical colonoscopy because of left colon rigidity and poor patient tolerance. Endoscopy reported superficial mucosal changes consistent with the disease, plus pseudopolyps in the explored descending colon.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
During consultation with the patient and referring clinician, the attending radiologist proposed contrast-enhanced water enema multidetector CT colonography (WE-MDCT) to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of endoluminal, mural, and pericolonic changes.After standard bowel cleansing preparation (3 liters polyethylene-glycol solution the day before), WE-MDCT was performed with pharmacological hypotonization (20mg intravenous N-butyl-scopolamine), instillation of 1, 5 liters warm tap water through a rectal tube, volumetric acquisition with the patient supine starting 75 seconds after 120 ml contrast medium injection.Multiplanar reformatted CT images depicted extensive longitudinal inflammatory involvement of the rigid, poorly distended descending colon, showing moderate, enhancing circumferential wall thickening. Furthermore, some millimetric endoluminal projections corresponding to endoscopic finding of pseudopolyps were identifiable. Ancillary inflammatory findings included proliferating pericolonic fat with hypervascularity (comb sign) and tiny lymphnodes. The well-distended recto-sigmoid, transverse and right colon did not show appreciable mural thickening, stenosis or endoluminal vegetations. Extraluminal abnormalities and complications were confidently excluded.

This case deals with an eight-year-old child, who presented with an insidious onset of diarrhea, later associated with hematochezia. Systemic signs were also present, including fever, weight loss andhypoalbuminemia.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
An eight-year-old child presented to our hospital with a two-month history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, marked weight loss and fever, which were recently associated with hematochezia andhypoalbuminemia. A complete blood count was obtained, which indicated leukocytosis and anemia, with an elevated sedimentation rate (i.e., findings consistent with inflammatory activity). The stoolwas examined for the presence of blood and to exclude the possibility of any intestinal infestation (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Yersinia and Aeromonas). A single-contrast bariumenema was performed to evaluate the colon. The roentgen findings were found to be characteristic in this case. The colon was found shortened and its lumen had been narrowed by muscular spasm andfibrosis, the spasm reduces the lumen to the caliber of a string (so-called ��string sign��). The haustral sacculations were flattened. In the case presented here, the barium enema showedthe narrow, stiff, smooth, and tubular appearance of the colon especially in the transverse portion, where multiple round marginal filling defects and slightly irregular mucosal margins were alsovisible. The whole colon appeared rigid and lacked the normal mucosal relief. Considering the advanced stage of the disease, the patient directly underwent a partial colectomy that confirmed thediagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

During a routine consultation a paediatrician noticed the presence of hepatomegaly at physical examination. The patient was asymptomatic. At physical examination there were no other abnormalities. An ultrasound scan (US) of the abdomen was requested.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Abdominal US showed bilateral adrenal masses, hepatomegaly and multiple nodular lesions in the liver favouring metastases (Figure 1). Subsequently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done and confirmed the US findings, demonstrating two well-defined adrenal enhancing masses. These lesions did not have an infiltrative component and there was no invasion of adjacent structures. The left adrenal mass encircled the superior mesenteric artery (Figure 2).Laboratory studies showed increased urinary catecholamines (vanillymandelic acid and homovanillic acid). Genetic test for n-myc was negative. US-guided biopsy was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of neuroblastoma.Our patient was classified as Ms by International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) and stage 4s by International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS). Treatment, decided at a multidisciplinary discussion, was watchful waiting.Follow-up US and MRI were performed and showed regression of the adrenal lesions and metastatic liver disease with no detectable lesions after 22 months follow-up (Figure 3).

A 61-year-old male patient, with known metastasised rectal cancer, presented with severe pain in the left hip since a few months. The pain was situated in the dorsal gluteal region, radiating to the perineum and the left groin and knee, and was worse in the evening and at night.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
An x-ray and ultrasound of the left hip did not reveal any significant abnormalities or degeneration. The most recent CT in the context of his oncologic follow-up, a few weeks earlier, showed increased enlargement and partial confluence of the known iliac adenopathies on the left (Figure 1).Subsequently, a contrast-enhanced MRI of the pelvis was performed for further evaluation. This showed a thickened and oedematous obturator nerve on the left side, completely encased by the iliac adenopathies on its proximal course (Figures 2, 3a, 3b, and 3c). Muscle oedema was present in the left obturator externus muscle and, to a lesser extent, in the left adductor magnus, brevis and longus muscles, all innervated by the obturator nerve, as a sign of denervation (Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c). Secondary asymmetrical, mild fatty atrophy was already present in the previously described muscles (Figures 5a and 5b).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 48-year-old woman with no history of a single trauma presented with pain in the right forearm and loss of flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger and interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the elbow and wrist was requested (Fig. 1-4).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Increased signal intensity is depicted on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images (WI) in keeping with muscle oedema in the radial half of the flexor digitorum profundus, the flexor pollicis longus and the pronator quadratus muscles (Fig. 1-3). Furthermore, fatty infiltration and atrophy is seen on the T1-WI (Fig. 4). These imaging findings are consistent with subacute to chronic denervation of the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN). No compression or entrapment of the nerve could be demonstrated. Diagnosis of a complete interosseous syndrome was made.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 68-year-old male presented with a gradually enlarging swelling over the anterior aspect of the right ankle, first noticed two years earlier. He reported no pain, trauma, functional limitation, or gait disturbance. On examination, a ~5 cm, well-circumscribed, mobile, and non-tender soft tissue mass was observed, not adherent to deep planes and without skin changes or signs of inflammation.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Ultrasound demonstrated a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass measuring 33 �� 28 �� 14 mm (L �� AP �� T) within the subcutaneous tissue, completely enveloping the tibialis anterior tendon. The lesion exhibited a heterogeneous echotexture, predominantly iso-echoic relative to the surrounding fat (Figures 1 and 2).Subsequent MRI revealed a fusiform, encapsulated mass located within the subcutaneous plane, anterior to the aponeurosis, and circumferentially enveloping the tibialis anterior tendon (Figure 3). The lesion appeared hyperintense on T1-weighted sequences with multiple internal hypointense septations (Figure 3), showed high-signal intensity on T2-weighted gradient-echo sequences (Figure 4), and demonstrated marked hypointensity on fat-suppressed proton density-weighted images (Figures 5 and 6). Across all sequences, the signal characteristics closely resembled those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, consistent with a lipomatous composition.

An 82-year-old gentleman was referred to gastroenterology by his GP with obstructive LFTs of several months duration. He was known to have chronic cholecystitis and gallstones from a previous ultrasound. He had no focal or constitutional symptoms and the physical examination was unremarkable. He was referred for MRCP before elective cholecystectomy.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
MRCP showed an area of abnormal soft tissue in the porta hepatis causing a stricture of approximately 4cm in the CBD. There were calculi in the gallbladder and lower third of the CBD. Intrahepatic biliary radicals were dilated. This was thought to resemble cholangiocarcinoma.The patient proceeded to CT which confirmed moderate intrahepatic cholestasis and showed circumferential wall thickening of the proximal CBD with stones in the mid and distal parts. There was associated local lymphadenopathy.On the basis of these findings the patient underwent ERCP for a presumed diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (with ductal calculi).Biopsies from the ampulla showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.PET CT showed the known common bile duct/ampullary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and low volume adjacent lymph nodes were markedly hypermetabolic, but showed no evidence of distant disease.The patient was diagnosed with stage IIA disease, three cycles of attenuated R-CHOP chemotherapy are planned followed by repeat PET to assess the possibility of consolidatory radiotherapy.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Female patient, 43 years old, with a slight neck mass on palpation. She had no relevant previous medical history, and no familial history of thyroid cancer. Physical examination was unremarkable besides the already mentioned neck mass.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Initial ultrasound examination with fine-needle aspiration was done, with inconclusive results. A neck computed tomography (CT) with and without contrast was performed for characterisation and revealed a well-defined 9 cm soft tissue mass in the right infrahyoid carotid space with extension to the upper mediastinum, displacing the visceral space medially (Fig. 1). The lesion also displaced the internal jugular vein anteriorly and the common carotid vessel posteriorly, encasing this vessel without compressing it. After contrast administration the lesion had mild peripheral enhancement and small, central, hypoenhancing areas. There were no calcifications. Several prominent lymph nodes were identified on the right anterior cervical space, but no other lesions were identified.On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this lesion exhibited spontaneously low T1 and high T2-STIR signal, with mild enhancement after contrast administration (Fig. 2). A PET-CT was performed outside of the authors�� hospital institution, which showed avid FDG uptake associated with the mass.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A previously healthy young woman complained of right lower chest discomfort for 10 months.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient presented with a 10-month history of right lower chest discomfort. Physical examination and laboratory findings were normal.Chest radiography revealed an ovoid mass in the right paracardiac region (Fig. 1a). MR imaging revealed a well-defined mass in the right cardiophrenic region. The mass was slightly hyperintense to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images, and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted and enhanced T1-weighted images (Figs 1b-1e).During surgery, a 5cm encapsulated mass originating from the right paracardiac parietal pleura, with blood supplies from the pleural arteries, was found. Adhesion of the mass to the adjacent pericardium, right hemidiaphragm, and right middle and lower lobes was also noted. Radical tumour resection was performed.Microscopically, the lesion was composed of germinal follicles with hyalinised vessels surrounded by onion-like layers of small lymphocytes and prominent vascular stroma in the interfollicular tissue with lymphocytic infiltration. The adjacent lung and pericardial tissues appeared normal. The final diagnosis was Castleman disease of the hyaline-vascular subtype.The patient has been followed-up for 8 years with no further chest discomfort.

A 34-year-old male with one week of sudden-onset fever, abdominal pain, cervicalgia, myalgia, palpitations and shortness of breath. Recent history of travel to Africa for 1 month, and medications for malaria prophylaxis and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. On examination, he had a fever of 38,2��C, tachycardia and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. Initial workup was non-contributory, with normal CBC, BMP, chest x-ray, and abdomen ultrasound. With wide differentials, including endemic, infectious and neoplastic conditions, CT of the head, neck and chest was performed and was unrevealing. Serology and lumbar puncture were also performed and were unremarkable.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, and revealed a 3.7 x 3.1 x 5.1 cm, avidly enhancing paraduodenal mass with central calcification (Figures 1a and 1b), presumed to be an enlarged lymph node. Adjacent organs, including the bowel, were unremarkable. There was no lymphadenopathy elsewhere. An endoscopic ultrasound was done (Figures 2a and 2b) to obtain an aspiration biopsy that revealed B-cell follicles with no evidence of malignancy. After discussion, the patient opted for watchful waiting. A follow-up CT done after 4 months demonstrated no significant change in size or appearance of the mass. This was subsequently excised, and histopathology revealed the final diagnosis.

A 37-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with acute pelvic pain in the left iliac fossa, that had begun 6 hours before, and fever (38.2��C). She had a past history of two caesarean sections. Laboratory investigations showed a C-reactive protein of 25.1 mg/dl and white blood cell count of 21.3x103/ml (neutrophils 84%).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Transvaginal ultrasound detected a complex and painful mass in left pelvis; it was 8 cm in diameter with thickened peripheral wall and internal septa and a simil-fluid content with a lot of internal echoes (Fig. 1). Left ovary was not recognisable.A CT examination performed with i.v. injection of contrast media confirmed the presence of a left tubo-adnexal multiloculated complex mass with solid-cystic components and contrast-enhanced peripheral wall and septa (Fig. 2a). Uterus was dislocated towards the right pelvis. The contralateral ovary appeared normal. No free peritoneal fluid was detected. Cranially the mass was adjacent to sigmoid colon and the sigmoid wall was thickened with hyperdense appearance of perivisceral fat (Fig. 2b). Diverticula were seen both in sigmoid and in descending colon (Fig. 2c).The suggested diagnosis based on imaging findings was left Fallopian tube abscess caused by a sigmoid diverticulitis. The surgeons during laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis and performed Hartman procedure and hysteroannessiectomy.

A 39-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department because of acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemoptysis. She had a history of large ventricular septum defect for which she had undergone belated surgery at the age of 4. Upon admission, a PCR for SARS-CoV2 returned positive. In the next few days, her status was complicated by heart failure.

A first CT scan was performed upon admission to rule out COVID 19 pneumonia and pulmonary embolism (PE) (Figure 1). No lesions typical of COVID 19 pneumonia nor PE were seen. However, some centrilobular nodules and serpiginous vessels could be spotted in both lungs. Signs of severe chronic pulmonary hypertension were evident. A second CT (Figure 2) was performed when heart failure symptoms appeared to detect the occurrence of PE and/or pneumonia. Extensive bilateral basal pneumonia was present. Moreover, during this pulmonary arterial phase, a moderately hyperdense area in the left ventricular outflow tract could be seen. This image was not visible on a CT scan performed 5 years prior (Figure 3). On the contrary, this old scan showed already nodular lesions with characteristics similar to those on the first scan of the actual hospitalisation.

Medical history included several cardiovascular risk factors, obliterating atheromatous disease of the lower limbs.Serum troponin I and electrocardiographic findings were consistent with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Early coronary angiography identified a critical stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA), which was treated by stenting. 24 hours later the patient experienced haemodynamic shock, intra-aortic balloon pump was positioned, repeated coronary angiography positioned a second RCA stent just proximally to the previous one.During further deterioration with severe shock and metabolic acidosis, echocardiography detected appearance of pericardial effusion. Emergency multidetector CT (Fig.1) showed hemopericardium, contrast medium flowing through a full-thickness discontinuity of the left ventricle (LV) lateral wall consistent with complete myocardial rupture.Immediate cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation was performed. After pericardiotomy, partially clotted blood was removed from the pericardial cavity and active bleeding from the LV free wall was detected in the territory of the obtuse marginal branch. Surrounded by friable necrotic myocardium, the laceration was repaired by mattress suture. The patient eventually recovered after intensive care including dialysis to treat acute kidney injury.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 16-year-old boy was referred to our emergency department three hours after a fight, with a penetrating stab wound above his left mammillary region. He was anxious, slightly dyspnoeic, but with good pulse and without jugular distension. His blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) were unremarkable.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Chest radiograph showed a cardiac silhouette with the varying cardiac density sign, abnormal bulge of left cardiac contour and a translucent line delineating the left mediastinal superior border (Fig. 1).An unenhanced and enhanced non-ECG gated multidetector CT was performed. A small left pneumothorax was seen (Fig. 2). Linear air-bubbles in the third left intercostal space revealed the wound track. A dense heterogeneous effusion (50 HU) in superior pericardial recess was seen, consistent with haemopericardium (Fig. 3). Enhanced CT revealed a linear high density in haemopericardium in front of right ventricular apex suggesting myocardial perforation and contrast extravasation into pericardial sac (Fig. 4).Transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed a heterogeneous hyperechogenic pericardial effusion suggesting active hemorrhage. Cardiac contractility and function were normal (Fig. 5).Patient immediately underwent cardiac surgery, which confirmed right ventricular laceration and a blood clot sealing the wound. Rupture of the root of great vessels was excluded, confirming CT findings.

### Question
Based on the clinical history and imaging findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?

### Options
A. Extraluminal enteric material
B. Abscess
C. Iatrogenic intraoperative ureteral injury with urinoma.
D. Loculated ascites
E. Postoperative fluid collection / seroma

Please analyze this case and select the correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E).","[Relevant Case 12226]
Reason for relevance: Pelvic fluid collection is partially opacified on delayed/excretory-phase CT (higher attenuation within collection) with a visible track of contrast from the right distal ureter into the collection — classic CT-urography demonstration of iatrogenic ureteral leak/urinoma after pelvic surgery.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A perimenopausal woman suffering from menometrorrhagia underwent total abdominal laparoscopic hysterectomy and adnexectomy after preoperative diagnosis of large (12 cm) uterine leiomyoma, and was discharged on third postoperative day after an uneventful course.Three days later, she presented to the emergency department with fever (39��C) unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics and pelvic tenderness.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Vaginal examination palpated a soft mass, corresponding to a sizeable hypoanechoic collection on ultrasound (Fig. 1), which was interpreted as vaginal stump haematoma by gynaecologists but doubled in volume 72 hours later. Laboratory assays revealed markedly abnormal urinalysis with raised C-reactive protein (329 mg/l). Then, urgent multidetector CT (Fig. 2) depicted a large fluid-attenuation collection cranial to the urinary bladder and vagina, partially opacified in the excretory phase, consistent with urinoma from incomplete right ureteral laceration.Conservative treatment included ureteral stenting and prolonged catheterization. Two days later, unenhanced CT (Fig. 3) showed minimal size decrease of the urinoma. Meanwhile, pathology revealed an intra-myometrial proliferation consistent with endometrial stromal sarcoma.One month later, follow-up CT (Fig. 4a, b) showed near-complete resolution of the urinoma, ipsilateral development of abnormal nephrographic appearance and of enhancing urothelial thickening suggesting pyeloureteritis and pyelonephritis. With the ureteral stent still in place, further CT follow-up at 2 months (Fig. 4c, d) showed progression of infectious reno-ureteral changes.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Male patient with vague, long-standing history of urolithiasis and benign prostatic hypertrophy, admitted to Emergency Department with acute right flank pain, without associated macroscopic haematuria nor significantly abnormal laboratory tests.Sufficiently preserved renal function (estimated Glomerular Filtration rate 65 ml/min using MDRD equation).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
With the patient still in Emergency, urgent unenhanced CT was requested to investigate suspected renal colic due to urolithiasis and exclude possible alternative diagnoses. After catheterisation, the bladder appeared contracted with severe circumferential mural thickening and multiple calculi, consistent with chronic urinary retention due to prostatic enlargement. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis was observed, associated with fluid-like effusion surrounding the renal pelvis and proximal ureter.Further investigation with enhanced CT was performed: after contrast administration, fair nephrographic phase and urinary opacification were observed bilaterally. The right-sided peri- and posterior pararenal fluid extravasation became strongly hyperdense in the excretory phase corresponding to extravasated urine, allowing diagnosis of retroperitoneal urinoma.Completion with 3D volume rendering images allowed visualisation of size and shape of the urinoma, with its spatial relationship to the kidney, pelvis and proximal ureter.After 10 days of conservative treatment including antibiotics, perinephric fluid collection was no more identifiable at follow-up ultrasound.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Elderly patient with history of diabetes, hypertension and previous aortocoronary bypass surgery presented to emergency department because of right-sided thoraco-abdominal trauma following a fall. Physical examination revealed extensive flank ecchymosis, in part attributed to oral anticoagulant therapy. Urgent laboratory tests revealed absent blood loss, normal renal function, microscopic haematuria.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A previous CT (Fig. 1) obtained eight months earlier to investigate infrarenal aorta dilatation, revealed bilateral peripelvic renal cysts.Currently, chest radiographs (not shown) did not show traumatic rib fractures and bedside ultrasound excluded haemoperitoneum. Due to microscopic haematuria and anticoagulation, multidetector CT (Fig. 2) was requested to investigate suspected renal injuries. Ipsilateral to trauma, CT showed moderate perirenal and fascial fluid, plus dependent hyperattenuation consistent with acute blood in the renal pelvis and a peripelvic cyst, without contrast medium extravasation indicating active arterial bleeding. Additional excretory-phase CT acquisition showed normal parenchymal and collecting system opacification, medial perirenal extraluminal opacified urine originating from a breach at the ureteropelvic junction, and opacified proximal ureter; findings consistent with partial ureteropelvic junction laceration. No traumatic lesions were seen in the other abdomino-pelvic organs.The patient was immediately treated with ureteral stenting, which remained in place for 6 weeks and allowed an uneventful course.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 67-year-old male patient with a known history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) came to our attention because of signs and symptoms of acute abdomen, with bowel closed to faeces and gas.Haematochemical examinations showed leucocytosis (12.330 WBC/microL), increase of creatinine levels (7, 23 mg/dL) and LDH (230 U/L). Diuresis was preserved.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Plain X-ray of the abdomen revealed air-fluid levels within the small bowel. Chest X-ray showed minimal pleural effusion (Fig.1, 2). At US abdominal examination, a fluid collection was observed in the retroperitoneum on both sides. Bilateral, multiple, parapyelic cysts and hydroureteronephrosis were also detected; small bowel peristalsis was present in all explored tracts (Fig.3).Baseline CT revealed a large retroperitoneal hydric collection with bilateral hydronephrosis and without intraperitoneal fluid (Fig. 4). Dynamic arterial and venous phases allowed excluding small bowel disease (Fig. 5).In the urographic phase, a clear extravasation of iodinated contast material (CM) from both ureters was visible, with leakage at the level of the renal pelvis on the right and at the calico-pyelic level on the left (Fig. 6). The distal ureters were normal. BHP was confirmed.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A female patient with previous radical hysterectomy plus radiotherapy for endometrial carcinoma four years earlier, underwent repeated surgery for left-sided pelvic neoplastic recurrence and was discharged after an uneventful postoperative course.Afterwards, she began complaining of vaginal discomfort and discharge, without abnormal findings (particularly identifiable fistulous orifices) at gynaecological examination.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Compared to previous studies, preoperative CT (Fig. 1) showed appearance of a 3 cm peripherally enhancing lesion consistent with local neoplastic recurrence.Three weeks after pelvic surgery, CT including multiplanar excretory-phase images (Fig. 2) showed well-distended opacified urinary bladder with Foley catheter and left-sided ureteral stent in place, bilaterally normal nephrographic and pyelographic appearances, nondilated collecting systems and lateral retraction and opacification of the vagina through a short communication indicating vesicovaginal fistula.Treatment included electrocoagulation of vaginal fistulous orifice, long-term antibiotics and ureteral stenting. Six months later CT-urography (Fig. 3) showed persistent vaginal opacification through a high-output supratrigonal vesicovaginal fistula.One year after surgery repeated CT (Fig. 4a��c) showed absent vaginal opacification indicating fistula closure, without signs of tumour recurrence. With ureteral stent still in place, follow-up CT three years after surgery (Fig. 4d��g) showed ipsilateral decreased renal size and parenchymal thickness, appearance of ureteropelvic mural thickening interpreted as chronic infectious pyeloureteritis, and persistently healed vesicovaginal fistula.
