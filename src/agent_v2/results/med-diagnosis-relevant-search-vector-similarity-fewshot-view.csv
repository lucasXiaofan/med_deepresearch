--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient initially presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure including visual disturbance, retinal stasis, paresis of the VIth cranial nerve, and headaches. An MRI examination revealed a pineal mass. The diagnosis of pineoblastoma was established by stereotactic biopsy, and an intraventricular shunt tube was placed. Radiotherapy was applied with a dose of 64Gy. On a 1-year follow-up MRI the tumour revealed changes in the contrast enhancement pattern compared to the initial study. On the 3-year follow-up study, however, diffuse leptomeningeal and ependymal dissemination of the tumour was detected, and the patient died shortly thereafter.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Pineoblastomas are uncommon pineal tumors, which demonstrate rapid growing and poor prognosis. We report the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented  a pineoblastoma with unusual venticular extension.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 14-year-old girl presented with a 6-week history of severe headache. Neurological examination showed bilateral papilledema. Computed tomography revealed a pineal region mass without hydrocephalus. Brain MR imaging was performed 2 months later in a 1.5T scanner with standard technique (T1-weightedimages before and after intravenous contrast administration). It showed a pineal region tumor continuously invading through the tectum into the cerebral aqueduct with the preservation of the adjacent structures. The tumor appeared an iso to hypointense mass on T1-weighted images, a heterogeneous iso to hyperintense mass on T2-weighted images, and a heterogeneously enhanced mass after administration of contrast medium. Histological examination after endoscopic biopsy of the pineal region, confirmed that the tumor was a pineoblastoma. There was evidence of dissemination in the chiasmatic region, but no other localisation in the rest of the central nervous system or any systemic metastatic lesions. Radiotherapy was given to the whole brain and the spinal cord, and magnetic resonance imaging showed  remission of the tumor.

A six-year-old boy presented with headache of two months�� duration and two episodes of vomiting. On examination the child was afebrile and routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Non-contrast sagittal computed tomography (CT) image shows central calcifications within a mildly hyperdense mass lesion involving pineal gland causing proximal hydrocephalus.Plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ill-defined T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense lesion measuring ~ 1.6x1.9x2 cm with perilesional oedema involving the pineal gland, extending into the tectal plate, the posterior aspect of midbrain, pons, medulla, right superior and middle cerebellar peduncles. There was no diffusion restriction. Few foci of blooming on gradient images were seen, which represented calcifications. The lesion was seen to cause significant mass effect on aqueduct of Sylvius resulting in gross dilatation of both lateral and third ventricles (Evans index: 0.53). There was no midline shift.Post-contrast T1 MRI images show avid enhancement of the lesion. There was no abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brain.The possibility of CSF seeding necessitates imaging evaluation of the entire neuroaxis.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 27-year-old man, previously in good health, developed progressive headache, confusion, imbalance and vomiting over the two months prior to admission. Neurological examination showed Parinaud`ssyndrome (paralysis of upward gaze and accommodation). Noncontrast brain CT demonstrated small hyperdense masses in the floor of the third ventricle and in the pineal region. Acute obstructivehydrocephalus was present. The masses enhanced strongly and uniformly after contrast administration (Figure 1). Brain MR imaging, both with and without contrast administration, revealed a soft tissuemass within the posterior recesses of the third ventricle and extending to both thalami. Synchronous small focal masses were identified within the anterior recesses of the third ventricle and in thefastigium of the fourth ventricle. Supratentorial hydrocephalus was present, due to blockage of the aqueduct of Sylvius (Figures 2 and 3).

Only seven cases of pineal lymphomas have been cited in literature, almost of secondary lymphoma.We report a new case of primary B-type large cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in an immunocompetent 24 year old man, diagnosed by MR-guided stereotactic biopsy and treated successfully by radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 24 year old man presented with a 4 month history of progressive headache, with morning vomiting and recent visual loss and diplopia. Physical examination revealed left abducens nerve palsy. No superficial lymphadenopathy was noted.Computed tomography (CT) showed a pineal region process of 3 cm, well delineated, and presenting a spontaneous high density, homogeneous, with a central calcification. Perilesional oedema and mass effect were moderated. The lesion involved the posterior part of the third ventricle, and both thalami (��butterfly sign��). There was an active triventricular hydrocephalous, secondary to mesencephalic aqueduct compression.On MRI, the lesion was isointense to the grey matter in T1weighted images (WI), quite hyperintense in T2WI with a central asignal area corresponding to the calcification. It showed intense and homogeneaous contrast enhancement (Fig 1).A ventriculo-peritoneal derivation was performed to resolve symptoms of raised intracranial pressure with good control on CT (Fig 2).Tumour markers (alphafoeto-protein, beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin and carcino-embryonic antigen) were not found in blood and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). CSF cytology was negative.Arteriography showed a discrete tumoural blush from posterior-medial choroidal arteries and internal cerebral vein displacement (Fig 3).MR-guided stereotactic biopsy was improved. Histopathologic diagnosis was large cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), marked positively by anti-CD20 and anti-CD23, B-cell markers.Chest, abdomen and pelvis CT imaging revealed no lesions.He received chemotherapy (CHOP) followed by cranial radiotherapy with complete remission within 3 years.

A middle-aged, otherwise healthy woman was referred for an MRI of the right knee. She complained of a mass below the knee cap, that she had already noticed a year ago and that had become moderately tender within the last few weeks. A history of trauma was denied.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
MRI showed a 20 x 36 x 37 mm, smoothly marginated mass in the lateral infrapatellar fat pad of the knee with intimate contact to the dorsal surface of the patellar tendon. On T1-weighted images, it appeared isointense to muscle and displayed a concentric, onion-layer-like pattern. On T2-weighted images, it appeared heterogeneously hyperintense, with some oedema in the adjacent subcutaneous fat tissue (Fig. 1a). There were no susceptibility artifacts on gradient echo sequences (Fig. 1b). Contrast medium was not administered. The lesion was surgically excised in toto without prior biopsy. Histology showed a hypocellular tissue with abundant collagen, some hyalinization and slit-like vascular channels. The spindle-shaped cellular components were arranged in fascicles. There were no giant cells or siderophages (Fig. 2). The specimen also included parts of a synovial bursa (probably the deep infrapatellar bursa).

A 73 year old man complained of ulnar wrist pain. A palpable mass was present in his left ulnar wrist, which had been known to him for years, but used to be painless until a week ago.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 73 year old man was referred for imaging studies of the left hand and wrist. He complained of a mass in his ulnar wrist, which had been present for many years, but had become increasingly painful for about a week. The clinical examination confirmed a firm mass situated deep to the hypothenar musculature and extending to the dorsum manus. Dorsal extension of the wrist joint was slightly restricted. Apart from that, the patient��s past history was unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the left hand were obtained. The posteroanterior view showed a soft tissue mass which eroded the ulnar wrist bones and metacarpal bases (Fig 1). MRI better depicted the tumour extent amongst the wrist and metacarpal bones (Fig 2). The lesion completely surrounded the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon, but did not destroy it. On transverse sections, the tendon was situated near the centre of the mass, suggesting that it might have originated from the tendon sheath (Fig. 3). Based on the imaging findings, open excisional biopsy was performed and the specimen was sent to a national reference centre for soft tissue neoplasms, where the diagnosis of a benign, extraskeletal chondroma was made.

A 50-year-old patient with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome had an MRI performed. A soft tissue mass involving the median nerve and the flexor retinaculum was reported.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The ultrasound revealed an hypoechoic lesion at the volar side of the hand surrounding the flexor tendons, and Doppler colour showed rich vascularisation of the lesion (Fig 1).An MRI was performed demonstrating a rounded lesion surrounding the flexor tendons of the hand and also the median nerve. At the T1-weighted image it proved to be little hyperintense compared to the muscle (Fig. 2), and hyperintense at T2 Fat-sat weighted image (Fig 2). After injection of gadolinium the lesion showed avid peripheral enhancement (Figs. 4 and 5), maybe due to the myxoid component located in the middle of the lesion. All these findings suggested a soft tissue tumour or a tumour-like lesion, therefore a biopsy was recommended.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Ultrasound of the abdomen was obtained at ER admission revealing a mass in the left quadrant, adjacent to the descending colon. The mass was not solid, with internal debris and thickened walls, with densification of the adjacent peritoneal fat. A small amount of fluid was present in Douglas pouch.A CT examination was performed for aetiologic investigation, showing a hypodense mass in the left middle abdomen, adjacent to the descending colon. The mass had an internal liquid component, thickened and enhancing walls and measured 4.7 x 4.2 x 2 cm (transversal x longitudinal x anteroposterior).Surgical excision was performed. The mass was in the dependence of sigmoid colon mesentery and could easily be eradicated.Grossly, the mass was brown and yellow in colour and it was cavitated on the inside.Microscopically, it did not have inner lining, but there was abundant polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate.

A 3-months-old female presented with abdominal distension and a palpable lump on left side of abdomen. There were no other complaints of fever, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.Previous clinical history andlaboratory investigationswere unremarkable. Abdominal Ultrasoundand Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) were performed.(MRI abdomen was not performed as patient could not afford the cost of the investigation).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a relatively well-circumscribed thin-walled cystic lesion in mid abdomen displacing the bowel loops on the sides. There was no septation/ solid component within the cyst. CECT of abdomen revealed alarge, well-defined, thin walled, unilocular, non-enhancing cystic lesionmeasuring 9.2 cm (AP) X 9.6 cm (TRV) X 11.5 cm (CC) approxin the left side of abdomen extending from the level of D9 vertebra upto S1 vertebral level [Figure 1,2]. No septations/ calcification/fat/soft tissue component was seen within the lesion.The lesion displacedthe bowel loops and pancreas to the right and inferiorly (Figure 3).The lesion displacedthe left kidney posteriorly and compressed left upper ureter with mild prominence of left pelvicalyceal system (Figure 4). Intraoperatively a cyst was seen in the lesser sac (Figure 5)?with pancreatic body and tail splaying over the cyst (Figure 6). The cyst was separated and dissected from the tail of the pancreas and the adjacent structures (Figure 7,8).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
We report the case of a 43 year old male patient, admitted to hospital because of abdominal pain. CT and MRI was performed which revealed a cystic lesion. At laparoscopy a cystic, mass in the mesentery of the ileum was removed and turned out to be an abdominal cystic lymphangioma.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 43 years old male patient was referred to our hospital due to acute abdominal pain.  A medical history of appendectomy but no concomitant diseases were known. Physical examination revealed pressure pain of the whole abdomen. No other significant findings were noted. Laboratory data showed high C- reactive protein value of 314 mg/l.  Because of the clinical appearance a perforated diverticulitis was suspected. CT was performed to detect an abscess or inflammatory signs in the intestine.  This study showed a fatty cystic mass with circular contrast enhancement and 5.3 cm x 6.3 cm in size. This lesion was located in the mesentery of the left para-umbilical region and revealed attenuation values of fat (about -15 to -40 Hounsfield units). After intravenous contrast administration a wall enhancement of this lesion could be detected (Fig. 1). MRI confirmed this diagnosis and also revealed a cystic tumour with inflammatory changes in the ambient mesentery. Chemical shift gradient echo detected a central fatty structure in this lesion. The MRI study also showed some liquid components in this mass (Fig. 2,3). A cystic neoplasm of the mesentery was considered.At laparotomy, a soft cystic mass in the mesentery of the ileum with inflammatory changes was found and removed. The tumour was milky fluid-filled and partially adherent to the small bowel. Neither ascites was seen in the peritoneal cavity, nor dilatation nor were inflammatory changes of the intestine or mesentery found.Pathologic examination revealed the diagnosis of mesenteric uniloculated cystic lymphangioma.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital��s emergency unit with acute abdominal pain. The woman had diffuse pain in the abdomen, started acutely the same day. She had a history without any previous diseases. She had visited Morocco the week before

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
At the CT images, we see a hypodense lesion to the left, and anteriorly and posteriorly we see parts of the descending colon and laterally a part of the ileum (fig 1). We see reactions in the fatty tissue, especially towards the lateral small intestines (fig 1 and 2). At CT it looks like inflammatory changes in the fatty tissue; this is not seen at the MRI (fig 3-6). ?Combined information from the two modalities shows that the lesion is in the mesentery. MRI shows that it contains both fat and fluid. It is well delineated, but the CT indicates some reactive changes in the surrounding fat, especially towards the small intestine. Several small lymph nodes are present, best seen at CT (fig 2).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 32-year-old gentleman presented to A&E on three occasions, over a 2-month period, with alternating sites of abdominal pain worsened by oral intake. On examination, his abdomen was soft with generalised tenderness which was worst in the epigastrium. His blood results, including C-reactive protein, white cells, and lactate, were unremarkable.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Initially, an abdominal x-ray ruled out intestinal obstruction.Upon representation, an abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a 5cm avascular anechoic cystic mass within the left upper quadrant, with a small 2cm internal echoic segment. No other abnormalities in the abdominal viscera were noted.Further CT characterisation revealed this to be a fluid-filled density with a well-defined enhancing wall. Follow up CT after one month showed migration of the lesion towards the right side of the abdomen.A further MRI, undertaken to investigate an incidental liver cyst, confirmed a well-defined mass with a cystic component in the small bowel mesentery that had changed location. A fatty component was noted on the T1 weighted imaging suggesting a mesenteric dermoid cyst. The patient had a laparoscopic excision and histopathology revealed a cystic lymphangioma.

A 17 year old girl was presented with painless abdominal distention. Physical examination revealed a palpable abdominal mass. Laboratory tests were normal.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient was admitted to the hospital with painless abdominal distension and underwent ultrasonographic evaluation, which revealed a large left abdominal mass. The lesion was heterogeneous, mostly solid with a small cystic component, demonstrating prominent vascularity. A CT scan was done, revealing a well circumscribed mass, with 18 x 17 cm, localized predominantly in the left abdomen, originating from the right ovary. This mass was heterogeneous with an irregular shaped central cystic area, a lobulated soft tissue density component and a peripheral left hypodense area. After contrast administration there was enhancement of the central mass (Fig. 1a) and prominent vessels converging to the hilum were evident (Fig. 1b). Increased caliber of right ovarian vessels was also noted (Fig. 1b).On MRI the central mass was moderately hypointense on T1WI (Fig. 2), of intermediate signal intensity on T2WI (Fig. 3 a,b), with an irregular central cystic area. It was surrounded by a smoothly marginated solid component with hypointense capsule on T1WI and T2WI, crossed by several vessels. There was enhancement of the central mass and of the tumour capsule after gadolinium administration (Fig. 4).Surgery was done, with total resection of the mass and partial resection of the right fallopian tube (Fig. 5).The histological diagnosis was Sex Cord Stromal Tumour of Undetermined Pattern of the right ovary, consisting on two distinct components, one external corresponding to a fibrothecoma, and one internal of stromal origin with an undetermined pattern (Fig. 6,7).

A pelvic mass with partly solid and cystic morphology was detected at routine ultrasound in the 17th week of pregnancy in a 30-year-old patient. A follow-up after 3 weeks showed increasing size. Meanwhile, the patient had developed acne. Laboratory showed mild excess of androgens. Pelvic MRI was ordered.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Due to complex morphology and limitations in complete assessment of the lesion by sonography, MRI was warranted for further characterisation. MRI displays a well-circumscribed right adnexal mass measuring 13 cm in diameter. The mass is located in the pouch of Douglas and displaces the pregnant uterus superiorly and anteriorly with consecutive mass effect on the bladder (Fig. 1a, b). It shows partly cystic and solid architecture. The solid component displays intermediate SI on T1 and low to intermediate SI on T2 with scattered areas of high SI on T2 (Fig. 2a, b). Due to possible adverse effects on the fetus no IV Gadolinium was applied. The contralateral ovary appears normal, regional lymph nodes are insuspicious and there is no ascites. At the time of the presented case the additional value of DWI in pelvic masses was not yet established and DWI was unavailable.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 19-year-old patient presented with hirsutism and primary amenorrhoea. She had been treated for precocious puberty since the age of seven. The results of therapeutic trials and computed tomographyof the adrenal glands were found to be negative. A pelvic transabdominal ultrasonography revealed the presence of a hypoechoic lesion measuring 20 x 13 mm, with a 10 mm hyperechoic image with distalacoustic shadowing on the left adnexal region (Fig. 1). These aspects are suggestive of a teratoma. An MRI was proposed for the characterization of the lesion. When obtained, the MRI showed thepresence of a solid mass in the left ovary, with a higher signal intensity than the ovarian stroma in the T1-weighted image and a low signal intensity in the T2-weighted image. Aftercontrast-enhancement with Gd-DTPA, the fat-saturated T1-weighted image demonstrated the enhancement of the ovarian stroma and a lower intensity of the lesion (Fig. 2). On the basis of MRI findings, adiagnosis of a left ovarian tumour associated with androgenic production was suggested. The left ovary was resected at surgery. A pathological examination revealed the presence of awell-circumscribed tumour, measuring 20 mm along its longest axis, and brown in colour (Fig. 3). Histologically, the presence of clusters of polygonal large cells, uniform nuclei, eosinophilic andgranular cytoplasm without mitosis, and cellular atypia or crystals of Reinke were identified (Fig. 4).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 17-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because she had been experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding for 4 months and increasing pelvic discomfort 3 weeks prior to admission. Her medical andfamily history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed no sign of palpable abdominal mass, peripheral lymphadenopathy or lower extremity edema. Bimanual pelvic palpation was painful andrevealed a fixed bulky cervix. Cervical smear was performed repeatedly and it was negative. Blood evaluation was also normal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed in a 1 Tesla Unit using a pelvicphased array coil. MR demonstrated enlargement and infiltration of the uterine corpus and cervix. Clear margination of the lesion appeared, showing an abrupt line transition to the healthy uterinefundus. Despite the extensive involvement of the myometrium and cervical stroma, the endometrium and the cervical epithelium were preserved. The lesion exhibited a homogeneous hypointense signal onT1 WI and trufi images and was uniformly enhanced with gadolinium. The urinary bladder was pushed by the enlarged cervix but it remained intact. Bilateral hydronephrosis and dilatation of the ureterswere also present. Colposcopic biopsy established the diagnosis of primary lymphoma, MALT (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue) type. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. The patient was successfullytreated with chemotherapy thus resulting in marked remission.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 43-year-old female patient with a history of coeliac disease was referred to sonography due to an umbilical swelling. She reported an increasingly bloated abdomen and weight loss, diffuse abdominal discomfort and soft stools for several months. The umbilical swelling was cherry-sized, indurated, slightly purple and painful to touch.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Sonography of the umbilical lesion using a 10 MHz transducer was performed and showed an inhomogeneous irregular formation of approx. 2 x 2 x 1 cm and a discontinuity of the abdominal wall. The lesion remained unchanged at Valsalva manoeuvre, suggestive of an incarcerated hernia with unclear content (Fig. 1a, b).However, this lesion seemed to be only part of a larger process, as additionally free intraabdominal fluid and a huge intraabdominal mass were found (Fig. 1b, c, d). This mass was inhomogeneous, with a partially hyper and hypoechogenic cystic-solid aspect, and extended ventrally of the intestinal loops over the middle and lower abdomen.Further diagnostic work-up included an abdominal CT (Fig. 2) that showed the total extent of the intraabdominal mass and fluid, involving the whole abdominal cavity with perihepatic and perisplenic collections, the largest expansion can be seen in the ventral lower abdomen, reaching into the lesser pelvis.

A 23-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of right lower extremity paresis and sensory disturbances. Two weeks before he noticed a right inguinal mass and decided to consult us.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
After clinical examination an ultrasound was performed first. B mode US showed a nodular, lobed and hypoechoic right inguinal mass with an approximated size of 55x43x25 mm (Fig. 1 a). US Power Doppler demonstrated hypervascularization (Fig. 1 b). For further characterization an MR was made. MR-T1 weighted images (Fig. 2 a) located an hypointense mass above the psoas muscle, between the iliac-femoral veins and the sartorius muscle. On MR-T2 weighted images (Fig. 2 b) the mass appeared hyperintense. Diffusion WI sequences showed restriction of the water movement that indicated malignancy (Fig. 2 c). After the injection of gadolinium a heterogeneous and centripetal enhancement was demonstrated, suggesting necrotic areas inside the mass (Fig. 2 d). PET-CT indicated hypercaptation of the inguinal lesion without systemic extension (Fig. 3). The histopathological analysis demonstrated a round, small cell sarcoma. Finally FISH study showed translocation 11;22. The immunohistochemical test with Ki67 showed nuclear immunoreactivity of 70 % of the tumoural cells.

A 40 year old man with a palpable mass on the right thigh, with a progressive increase in size for the last five months.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
40 year old man referred to our institution for a painless palpable mass on the anteromedial aspect of his  right thigh with no surrounding erythematous reaction. Doppler ultrasound examination was performed, demonstrating an oval shaped lesion with heterogeneous echostructure and increased  vascularity.  ?  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study depicted a soft tissue mass involving the  anterior, medial and posterior compartments of the right thigh, with infiltration of the vastus (intermedius and medial), adductor brevis, biceps femoris, semi membranous and semitendinous  muscles. Invasion of the femoral cortical bone in the postero-medial  aspect of the distal diaphysis with associated invasion of the medullary cavity was also seen. The superficial femoral artery and vein as well as the sciatic nerve were surrounded by the tumoral  mass. The mass demonstrated high signal intensity on T2-weighted  images (fig.1), and areas of high signal intensity on fat suppressed T1-weighted images, consistent with hemorrhagic foci (fig 2). On Gadolinium enhanced images, the mass had a heterogeneous enhancement (fig.3). The findings were compatible with an aggressive soft tissue mass.  ?  Hystologic analysis demonstrated areas of well defined cartilage, associated withareas of neoplasic proliferation of the mesenchyma, formed by packs of small cells with oval hyperchromatic nuclei clustered together, along with vascular clefts and areas of necrosis(fig.4).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 70-year old patient presented with a large mass at the right gluteal region, which had increased in size and became extremely painful over the last six months.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The MRI sequences show a large complex cystic-soft tissue mass located at the right gluteal region, originating from the gluteus maximus muscle, associated with edematous infiltration of the overlying subcutaneous tissue, measuring 155/98/156 mm (tr/ap/cc). The lesion is composed of a cystic component with fluid-fluid levels denoting blood products of different ages, which occupies the majority of the mass, and a smaller solid component of low T1WI signal and intermediate/high T2WI/T2 STIR signal, consisting of thick septa and dispersed heterogeneous areas that are not so well defined.The mass exhibits scattered areas of signal loss on T2*WI, in keeping with the presence of bleeding of different stages.The post-contrast studies show a heterogeneous enhancement of the dividing septa, and partially of the soft tissue. The non-enhancing areas within the soft-tissue component suggest intratumoral necrosis.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 66-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a slow-growing mass on his left leg. He did not report pain, weakness or weight loss. The mass was firm and the skin was intact.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Ultrasound images show a 5 cm soft tissue mass located in the deep tissues subjacent to the superficial fascia (Fig. 1a). It appears to be densely calcified. Colour Doppler does not detect intralesional blood flow, probably due to the extensive calcification (Fig. 1b).Conventional radiographs show a large soft-tissue mass and confirm extensive calcification (Fig. 2a, b). CT shows small, granular, streaky and amorphous calcification located in the center of the mass (Fig. 3a, b).On MR images the central calcified area, with low intensity on both T1WI and fat-saturated DP-WI sequences, may be appreciated. The unmineralised peripheral area shows low-intermediate intensity on T1WI and high signal on fat-saturated PD-WI (Figs. 4a-d). Contrast-enhanced MRI exhibits peripheral, nodular and heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 4d).

A 74-year-old-male patient underwent abdominal ultrasound for ��on-and-off�� left flank pain. At ultrasound, anill-defined focallesion was detected at the upperpoleof the left kidney, the lesion was slightlyhypoechoicand measured1 cm.He was admitted to the Urological Departmentforfurther evaluation to rule out any underlying malignancy. Laboratory test results did not show any significant abnormalities.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after intravenous contrast administration. AT CT an hypervascular solid nodule was detected, suggestive of a neoplastic lesion.At unenhanced CT the lesion was not identified because isodense to renal parenchyma. After intravenous contrast administration, a solid nodular lesionof 1 centimetre in diameterwas detected at the upper pole of the left kidney.In the early arterial phase, thelesion displayed diffuse and rapid enhancement appearing hypervascular.In the cortico-medullary phase, the lesionremainedmarkedly hyperdense. Inthe parenchymal phase, the lesion showed complete washout andappeared hypodense compared tothe adjacentrenal parenchyma.The lesion margins were well-defined and anteriorlylobulated. A CT suspected diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney was formulated, and the patient was scheduled for left partial nephrectomy.The CT final diagnosis was suggestive of a neoplastic lesion. The patient underwent uneventful transperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. There were no postoperative complications, and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The final diagnosis based on histological examination was of a renal anastomosing haemangioma. At histology, the lesion was characterized by the presence of a sinusoidal-like pattern with occasional hyaline microthrombi and absence of cytological atypia or infiltration. Retrospectively, at CT the lesion appeared always isodense to the blood pool in all the contrast graphic phases.

A 64-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with haematuria. An abdominal ultrasound was performed and revealed a heterogeneous right renal mass. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was then performed to characterise the lesion.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Abdominal CECT showed an 8.3cm right cortical renal mass abutting the renal pelvis. It has heterogeneous and high contrast uptake on the arterial phase (Figure 1), suggesting the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.Incidentally, a well-circumscribed, 5.4cm, right adrenal mass was discovered, containing areas of macroscopic fat, diffuse speckled <5mm calcifications, with patchy and progressive contrast enhancement. There was no evident centripetal fill-in (Figure 2).The contralateral kidney and adrenal gland were unremarkable.Laboratory tests indicated a non-functional adrenal tumour, with urinary cortisol (32��g/24h), urinary metanephrine (32.9��g/24h), plasma aldosterone (7.1ng/dL), plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (5.9ng/dL per ng/mL/hr), kalemia (4.2mmol/L), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (46.2��g/dL), and testosterone (34ng/dL) within normal range.Based on these findings, adrenal haemangioma, myelolipoma, carcinoma, and metastasis are the main differential diagnoses.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Due to the symptoms the patient performed renal ultrasound which presented a large and heterogeneous hyperechoic lesion within and apparently extending beyond the left kidney.In order to adequate characterise the lesion, a MR imaging was performed, confirming the presence of a well defined renal mass, measuring 8x6x3.4cm, within the renal parenchyma and renal sinus. The mass was relatively homogeneous, presenting high signal intensity in T1 sequences (Fig 1 a, b) and intermediate signal in T2 sequences (Fig 2 a, b), with signal loss in fat-suppression sequences (Fig 1c and 2c). After gadolinium administration the lesion did not show significant enhancement (Fig 3).The lesion extended beyond the renal sinus into the left renal vein (Fig 4), reaching and growing through the inferior vena cava, extending to the level of the liver (Fig 5).The diagnosis proposed was of renal angiomyolipoma with extension into the inferior vena cava, which was confirmed after radical nephrectomy.

A 65-year-old female was admitted to the hospital due to a respiratory tract infection with respiratory insufficiency. Her medical history was significant for surgically removed transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder. During the ingress period, gross hematuria was detected but no malignant cells were found in the urine cytology.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Abdominal sonography showed a 4 cm left renal solid mass located in the renal sinus (Fig. 1). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of a rounded solid renal sinus lesion(Fig. 2). The intravenous urography showed distortion and partial filling of the lower caliceal system (Fig. 3). Because of the clinical history and radiological findings, a transitional cell tumor could not be ruled out, so a radical left nephrectomy was performed. The pathologic study of the resected kidney revealed a renal sinus lesion consistent with old venous thrombosis within a dilated vein (Fig. 4). No evidence of neoplasm was observed in the histological sections. After one year of follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic and the ultrasound showed no alterations apart from nephrectomy.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 39-year-old female presented with menorrhagia for 4 months. No associated dysmenorrhea or abdominal symptoms were detected. Following gynaecology review, an ultrasound of the pelvis was performed. Due to an incidental abnormal renal finding on this examination, computed tomography of the abdomen was subsequently performed.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Ultrasound scan of pelvis revealed normal appearances of the uterus, endometrium and ovaries for a pre-menopausal patient. Sonographic examination of the kidneys is routinely performed on all pelvis ultrasound examinations at our institution. A 6.4 x 8cm complex mass was incidentally noted arising from the interpolar region of the right kidney. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was recommended to further characterise this mass.A triphasic renal mass protocol CT of the abdomen demonstrated a corresponding 8cm multiseptated complex cystic mass arising from the anterior interpolar region of the right kidney, indenting the under-surface of the right lobe of the liver. There was no evidence of tumour extension or thrombus within the renal veins or IVC.As the imaging findings could not differentiate a cystic renal cell carcinoma from a multilocular cystic nephroma, the referring urologist elected to perform a right nephrectomy. Histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a multilocular cystic nephroma.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 33-year-old male with a history of appendectomy arrived at the emergency department (ED) with progressive abdominal pain. The abdominal imaging (X-ray and ultrasound) and blood tests were normal, resulting in discharging the patient with conservative treatment. 72 hours later the patient came back due to persistence of symptoms. A new laboratory analysis highlights elevated CRP 24.25 mg/dL (normal, 0-0,5 mg/dL) and Leukocytes 13.1 x 10E9/L (normal, 4.8-10.8 x 10E9/L).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound that showed a longitudinal section a hypoechoic tubular sac surrounded by increased echogenicity of the neighbouring fatty tissue (white arrows) near the ileum (Figure 1, A-B). For better characterization, an abdominal CT was performed (Figure 2, A-B: enhanced abdominal CT coronal reconstruction and Figure 3, A-D: enhanced abdominal CT axial and coronal reconstructions with maximum intensity projection and volume rendering MIP/VRT).Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed a collection in the right flank with alimentary content of 28x26 mm, dependent on middle ileum loop, suggestive of Meckel diverticulum. Accompanied by marked inflammatory involvement of the adjacent mesenteric fat, free fluid, and gas at the edge of the diverticulum, probably due to focal discontinuity and contained perforation. Moderate thickening of the wall of the ileum loops near the diverticulum and retrograde bowel dilatation due to ileus secondary to the inflammatory involvement are observed, as well as small reactive lymphadenopathy in the root of the mesentery(Figure 3, A-D: VRT reconstruction). There was no signs of acute diverticular bleeding. Arterial and venous vascular branches were patent. There was no pneumoperitoneum.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 29-year old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, and intermittent shivering, no laborchemical abnormalities. The patient was released on the suspicion of gastroenteritis but returned the following night with worsening pain in the right lower abdomen and an increase of inflammation markers.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The initial ultrasound showed a voluminous (ca.10 cm long, 4 cm wide), fluid-filled structure in the middle lower abdomen with sedimentation and questionable wall-margin. All the while the patient exhibited diffuse peritonitis.An emergency contrast-enhanced CT-scan was performed for the differentiation of the structure; the appendix was normal but the examination revealed a massive, blind-ending, tubular structure with enteroliths that appeared to emanate from the ileum, perforation had occurred with gas bubbles at the tip. There were also signs of small bowel obstruction in the right lower abdomen. The CT-diagnosis was that of a suspected Meckel-diverticulitis complicated by perforation and small bowel obstruction.The surgeon on call was promptly notified and the CT images where demonstrated and discussed. Emergency operation followed during which the suspected diagnosis was confirmed and partial ileal resection was performed. After a prolonged recovery, the patient could be discharged on the 10thpostoperative day.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 64-year-old man consulted in the Emergency Department for pain in the right iliac fossa over the past 3 hours, no fever and with normal blood tests. His personal history included previous episodes of reno-ureteral colic. The abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with rebound.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. In the right iliac fossa, a rounded, elongated structure, measuring 24 x 28mm (diameter x length), was visible protruding from the antimesenteric border of the distal ileum wall. The structure showed marked inflammatory changes in the adjacent mesenteric fat. In addition, a hyperdense, linear image 27mm in length, consistent with a foreign body (e.g., fishbone or bone fragment) was identified, crossing and perforating the diverticulum wall, and protruding into the adjacent mesenteric fat (Figures 1, 2). The findings were suggestive of Meckel's diverticulum perforated by a foreign body with inflammatory changes. There was no significant pneumoperitoneum or ascites. The cecal appendix was normal in calibre and morphology, with no surrounding inflammation (Figure 3). Surgery was performed, confirming the radiological findings, the foreign body being a fishbone (Figures 4, 5, 6).

Spinal MR depicted two tumors in the spinal canal, one in the cauda equina and another in the thoraco-lumbar junction, which were surgically resected.  Histology confirmed a benign myxopapillary ependymoma, type I.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 5 year old boy was referred to our hospital complaining of low back pain for the last 4 days. Physical examination revealed rigidity, while plain X-rays were unremarkable.Further investigation with MRI of the lumbar spine was deemed necessary. The patient was examined with a 1-Tesla MRI unit. Images were obtained in both axial and sagittal planes with T1, T2 weighted images (WI) as well as short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images. There was high signal intensity on the STIR images, within the spinal cord, from the level of D11-12 intervertebral disc up to S2 vertebra, suggestive of intraspinal oedema. On T1WI the lesion was inhomogeneously hypointense (Fig 1), and hyperintense on STIR images (Fig 2). A fluid-fluid level was noted on both sequences. After the administration of gadolinium the lesions exhibited avid enhancement with well-defined borders. The first lesion was located at the level of D11-12 intervertebral disk up to L2 vertebra and the second at the level of S1 up to S2 vertebrae. The spinal cord was markedly expanded (Fig 3).The differential included ependymoma and astrocytoma. The patient underwent surgical partial resection of the tumour.

A 17 years old patient was referred to the Radiology Department by his Neurosurgeon.  He had history of surgery one year ago because of a duble-lession in the lumbar spine.  Excision of the lesion was total and biopsy result myxopapillary ependymoma.  Whole spine and brain MRI exam performed after the surgery were normal.  The follow-up 6 months after the surgery was also normal.  At the time of presentation he was complaining for back pain.  Cerebral and spinal MRI exams were performed.  T1-weighted MR sagittal examination of the lumbosacral spine, showed an expansion of the spinal canal and the existence of dural nodules (fig 1a, b).  Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (fig 2a, b) demonstrated nodular enhancement on the spinal canal, in an intradural component, representing recurrence of the lumbar ependymoma.  Similar nodular appearance was noted on the thoracic and cervical spinal canal (figs 3, 4).  On cerebral MRI there was an abnormal enhancement in the right tentorium (fig 5), indicating a possible CSF dissemination and spread of the ependymoma.  CSF cytology was positive for dissemination of the ependymoma.

During consultation with the patient and referring clinician, the attending radiologist proposed contrast-enhanced water enema multidetector CT colonography (WE-MDCT) to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of endoluminal, mural, and pericolonic changes.After standard bowel cleansing preparation (3 liters polyethylene-glycol solution the day before), WE-MDCT was performed with pharmacological hypotonization (20mg intravenous N-butyl-scopolamine), instillation of 1, 5 liters warm tap water through a rectal tube, volumetric acquisition with the patient supine starting 75 seconds after 120 ml contrast medium injection.Multiplanar reformatted CT images depicted extensive longitudinal inflammatory involvement of the rigid, poorly distended descending colon, showing moderate, enhancing circumferential wall thickening. Furthermore, some millimetric endoluminal projections corresponding to endoscopic finding of pseudopolyps were identifiable. Ancillary inflammatory findings included proliferating pericolonic fat with hypervascularity (comb sign) and tiny lymphnodes. The well-distended recto-sigmoid, transverse and right colon did not show appreciable mural thickening, stenosis or endoluminal vegetations. Extraluminal abnormalities and complications were confidently excluded.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
The patient presented with altered bowel habits, weight loss, and a positive faecal occult blood test result. Colonoscopy was incomplete because of an obstructive lesion.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient presented with a clinical history of altered bowel habit, weight loss (6kg of body weight lost in 3 months), and a positive faecal occult blood test result. He underwent conventional colonoscopy, which failed to visualise the entire colon because of an obstructive lesion obstructive lesion located at the level of the recto-sigmoid junction. Therefore, the patient was immediately transferred to the Diagnostic Radiology Department to undergo contrast-enhanced CT colonography.CT colonography was completed according to a previously published approach [1]. CT colonography was able not only to detect the primitive, stenosing neoplasm but it also provided important additional information. First, CT colonography demonstrated that the primitive carcinoma invaded the bladder and prostate gland (Fig. 1). Second, a synchronous, stenosing tumour was identified within the descending colon (Fig. 2). Third, distant metastases could be demonstrated within the liver (two metastases; Fig. 3) and spleen (one metastasis; Fig. 4), as well as multiple peritoneal implants (Fig. 5).

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 64 year-old man underwent CT colonography following incomplete optical colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening purposes.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient underwent CT colonography (CTC) as diagnostic completion after an incomplete optical colonoscopy due to patient��s intolerance. The CTC acquisition was carried out in the supine and prone position using a low radiation dose protocol. Patient preparation for CTC consisted of residue-free diet starting three days before CTC, together with assumption of a mild laxative (polyethilenglycole, PEG) for colon cleaning purposes. Faecal tagging was also performed in order to improve diagnostic accuracy through oral administration of 50mL 370-mgI/mL iodinated contrast material three hours before CTC. Colonic distension was obtained by insufflating 3.5L of carbon dioxide through an automatic insufflator, together with administration of an antispasmodic agent (N-butylhyoscine bromide) in order to maximize colonic distension and improve patient comfort. CTC images obtained in the supine position showed a polyp in the descending colon that abuts in the colonic lumen, though it is not well characterized on 2D images or on virtual endoscopy views, as it is almost totally covered by the fluid remnant. On the other hand, the polyp can be well recognized on the images obtained in the prone position, and is characterized as a 13-mm mucosal pedunculated lesion. The above finding was further evaluated by means of virtual endoscopy and virtual dissection views of the colon. The remaining colonic segments were free from parietal lesions. Optic colonoscopy was subsequently performed that confirmed presence of the polyp. This latter was excised and was histologically characterized as a tubulo-villous adenoma with low grade dysplasia.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 40 year old woman with recurrent abdominal pain and constipation alternate with diarrhoea underwent optical colonoscopy (OC) that showed multiple submucosal nodules covered with normal mucosa in the transverse colon. Subsequently, a double contrast barium enema examination (DCBE) was carried out, revealing nonspecific irregularities of the colonic wall in the left flexure; however, no definite diagnosis was made. As a third step, CT colonography (CTC) was scheduled. Patient preparation included residue-free diet starting three days before the examination and administration of 2L of iso-osmolar solution (polyethilenglycole) as to maximize colonic distension three hours before CTC. Oral iodixanol was also introduced for fecal tagging, and carbon dioxide was used for colonic insufflation. CTC acquisition was performed in the supine and prone position following a low radiation dose acquisition protocol. Multiple gas-filled cysts within the wall of the distal third of the transverse colon were detected, allowing making a definite diagnosis of colonic pneumatosis. After CTC, the patient received medical therapy, resulting in clinical improvement.

Ultrasound abdomen identified a huge mass (> 20cm) within the abdomen, commencing immediately above the dome of the bladder, extending into the upper abdomen to the level of the pancreas. The mass extended from the anterior peritoneum, posteriorly to the pre-vertebral region, with a prominently midline/right paramidline position. Adjacent structures were displaced rather than invaded. All the solid organs were normal.CT confirmed a hugh peritoneal mass, with prominent perilesional and intralesional vascularity. The superior mesenteric vein was enlarged with multiple collateral vessels in the upper abdomen and right paracolic gutter. No distant disease identified.Although amenable to ultrasound guided biopsy a joint clinicoradiological decision was made, that open biopsy should be performed. This confirmed a vascular mass with necrotic components and haemorrhagic free fluid.

Colour Doppler revealed peripheral vascularity with an arterial waveform. A right-sided hydroureteronephrosis was noted. CT examination showed a mixed density mass lesion appearing to 'arise out of nowhere' lying above and behind the bladder, intraperitoneal in location, and displacing bowel loops but not causing bowel obstruction. The lesion showed peripheral enhancement with central areas of necrosis/haemorrhage. A linear hyperdense area was noted, similar to that on grey scale ultrasound, consistent with calcification. A right-sided hydroureteronephrosis was also seen due to compression of right ureter by the mass.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 52-year-old female patient presented with abdominal distension and non-specific abdominal discomfort. A plain abdominal film was obtained (Fig. 1a), which showed that there was a mass effect withloss of the retroperitoneal anatomical landmarks (left psoas line and left renal contour). Bizarre calcifications were identified on the left hemipelvis. An abdominal ultrasonographic study was done,which showed that there was a huge space-occupying lesion with areas of different echogenicity (Fig. 2a, b). The mass, in the upper portion was predominatly hyperechoic, a finding very suggestive ofand corresponding to a fatty component. The lesion in the lower portion (Fig. 2b) presented a more solid appearance. Helical computed tomography performed after intravenous contrast administrationshowed that the mass, with areas of fatty and solid attenuation values, was displacing the surrounding organs, and engulfing the left kidney (Fig. 3a, b, c). Pelvic calcifications inside the tumoralmass were identified. A magnetic resonance imaging study, with the T2-weighted technique (Fig. 4a, b), and T1-weighted images with contrast administration and fat-suppressed sequences (Fig. 4c, d),gave images which showed the huge lesion with areas of fatty component. The dynamic study after intravenous administration of gadolinium (Fig. 4c, d) showed the hypervascular nature of the lesion.

Our patient presented with a 3-week history of progressive abdominal distention, which on clinical examination was felt to be due to a large mass.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The baby boy was transferred with a 3-week history of progressive abdominal distension and poor weight gain (6.5kgs). Pregnancy and birth were uneventful at 40 weeks gestational age.On examination, the child was well, but had a large mass in the left flank. Blood pressure was 110/48mmHg. Catecholamine levels were normal.US showed a very large lobulated mass extending from the left upper quadrant across the midline and down into the left iliac fossa, where a septated cystic component was identified (Figs. 1a and b).CT confirmed the presence of a 15 x 12 x 12 cm well defined mass, which appeared to arise from the upper pole of the inferiorly displaced left kidney (Figs. 2a and b). The mass was heterogeneous, though predominantly of soft tissue attenuation. A low attenuation center was suggestive of necrosis. In addition, there were several scattered cystic areas apart from the larger septated cystic component in the pelvis (Fig. 2c).En-bloc resection was performed of the tumour and the left kidney. The mass was excised intact. Macroscopically the mass measured 14 x 11 x 10 cms after resection and weighed 1012 grams. The kidney was massively distorted by the tumor, but the renal pelvis and vessels were free of neoplastic infiltration.Cut sections revealed a fleshy nodular tumour with a central area of necrosis (Fig. 3). Scattered cystic areas were present with a single large 5cm multilocular cystic component in the pelvis. Histology revealed a mixture of paucicellular spindle cell areas (Fig. 4a) and a predominance of more cellular fascicular growth with a higher nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and a brisk mitotic rate (Fig. 4b). Neoplastic infiltration extended beyond the renal capsule into the perinephric fat with involvement of the specimen margins, thus constituting stage III disease.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A 38-year-old man presented to the GP with a 1-year-history of intermittent loin pain of increasing severity, associated with nausea and vomiting for two weeks prior to his presentation. Onexamination, he was found to be tender in the left loin. Initial investigations including urinalysis and routine blood tests were found to be normal. The patient had an intravenous urogram (IVU),which showed the presence of a calcific density measuring 4 mm, adjacent to the left iliac spine, and a markedly delayed left renal excretion. In view of the suspicion of renal tract obstruction dueto the presence of a ureteric stone in the pelvis, an unenhanced CT urography was performed, which demonstrated marked left hydronephrosis (Fig. 1a) and a hydroureter secondary to a large, mixeddensity pelvic mass measuring 10 cm in the long axis (Fig. 1b). There were multiple smaller peritoneal lesions seen throughout the abdomen. An US guided core biopsy of one of the peritoneal masseswas inconclusive, and open excision biopsies from the intra-abdominal and peritoneal lesions were obtained.

Furthermore, the origin of the plantar fascia near the calcaneum was also hypoechoic and thickened in comparison to the contralateral side. The diagnosis of lateral cord plantar fasciopathy (LCPF) in addition to central cord plantar fasciopathy (CCPF) was made.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 47-year-old male patient who complained of pain and numbness in the medial aspect of the sole of his foot for two months, and alteration of the electromyography in that location.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
On the lateral ankle radiograph we can see the talocalcaneal C sign (Fig 1), therefore MRI is performed to complete the study.MRI showed an overgrowth of the posteromedial subtalar facet and posterior-subtalar joint space narrowing associated. These findings were consistent with non osseous posteromedial subtalar coalition. MRI also revealed an increase of soft tissue inside the tarsal tunnel appearing hypointense on T1-weighted images and slightly hyperintense on STIR/T2 fat-satured weighted images, which means inflammation. We can also observe the presence of small cystic lesions inside the tunnel, better seen on STIR/T2 fat-satured weighted images, which are compatible with ganglions. Abductor hallucis is seen hyperintense on the axial T2 fat-saturated image, related to medial plantar nerve denervation oedema, secondary to compression by the posteromedial subtalar coalition.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 31-year-old man experienced pain at the medial side of his left talus during plantar flexion of his left foot. Symptoms started three months before when he began playing basketball. His symptoms were attributed to tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) and he was referred for an MRI.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
An MRI of his left ankle joint was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. There was a soleus muscle with a lower than usual tendon insertion into the achilles tendon [Fig.1-3]. Besides that, a volume of tissue was disclosed encircling the belly of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) muscle at the level of the ankle joint [Fig. 1b], where the belly of the FHL is expected to end. This tissue, distally to the ankle joint, seemed abutting the FHL tendon, and followed the tendon in front of the flexor retinaculum (FR) into the tarsal tunnel until the sustentaculum tali [Fig. 2, 3]. The nerves and vessels of the tarsal tunnel were displaced medially and backwards [Fig. 1b]. The signal intensity equalled that of muscle in all sequences [Fig. 2, 3]. There were no low signal intensity structures in this volume of tissue resembling tendons and/or vessels. The findings were interpreted as a low extending FHL muscle belly causing TTS.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
An 82-year-old gentleman was referred to gastroenterology by his GP with obstructive LFTs of several months duration. He was known to have chronic cholecystitis and gallstones from a previous ultrasound. He had no focal or constitutional symptoms and the physical examination was unremarkable. He was referred for MRCP before elective cholecystectomy.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
MRCP showed an area of abnormal soft tissue in the porta hepatis causing a stricture of approximately 4cm in the CBD. There were calculi in the gallbladder and lower third of the CBD. Intrahepatic biliary radicals were dilated. This was thought to resemble cholangiocarcinoma.The patient proceeded to CT which confirmed moderate intrahepatic cholestasis and showed circumferential wall thickening of the proximal CBD with stones in the mid and distal parts. There was associated local lymphadenopathy.On the basis of these findings the patient underwent ERCP for a presumed diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (with ductal calculi).Biopsies from the ampulla showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.PET CT showed the known common bile duct/ampullary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and low volume adjacent lymph nodes were markedly hypermetabolic, but showed no evidence of distant disease.The patient was diagnosed with stage IIA disease, three cycles of attenuated R-CHOP chemotherapy are planned followed by repeat PET to assess the possibility of consolidatory radiotherapy.

Signs and symptoms of obstructive jaundice.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient presented with a one-month history of altered bowel habit, loss of weight, loss of appetite, and a one-week history of jaundice with tea-coloured urine. Physical examination revealed jaundiced skin and sclera. No lymphadenopathy was found. There was mild epigastric tenderness but no abdominal mass was palpable. The liver and spleen were not clinically enlarged. Laboratory investigations on admission revealed elevated serum conjugated bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase levels, consistent with obstructive jaundice.Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a large hypoechoic mass in the  region of the pancreatic head. The extrahepatic duct was mildly dilated. Computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a  homogeneous soft tissue mass at the head of the pancreas, measuring 8.2cm x 4.4cm. The spleen was not enlarged. A single 1cm enlarged para-aortic lymph node was seen.A radiological diagnosis was made of carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, with regional lymph node metastasis, and the patient underwent surgery. Intraoperatively, there was a large pancreatic mass with enlarged mesenteric nodes. A Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy were performed and mesenteric nodes were sent for histopathological examination, which revealed high grade B-cell non-Hogdkin's lymphoma.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 48 year old woman, previously undergone thyroidectomy and radio-labelled therapy because of a follicular thyroid carcinoma (T3N1M0), referred to our hospital because of heaviness and tension localized in the inferior abdominal quadrants associated to pain, lasting for 3 months.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient underwent an ultrasound (US) examination of the abdomen, that showed a solid, well-marginated, homogeneously hypoechoic lesion, partially protruding from the anterior margin of the pancreatic head, determining a slight dilation of the main pancreatic duct (4mm). The lesion measured 30x30 mm and did not show any vascular echoes on colour-Doppler US study. A homogeneous, hypoechoic, circular wall thickening of the last small bowel loop was also observed (Fig.1).The patient underwent then a computed tomography (CT) examination. At baseline examination, the pancreatic mass showed as a solid, homogeneously hypodense lesion; a mild enhancement was appreciable after contrast medium administration, particularly during the late phase (Fig.2). No signs of peripancreatic structures infiltration were present.CT also confirmed the presence of wall thickening of the last ileal loop, extending to the ileo-caecal valve and to caecum wall. Intestinal lumen resulted to be dilated with non signs of obstruction. Pathological walls did show mild enhancement after contrast medium administration. No suspected lymph nodes were appreciable (Fig.3).On the basis of CT findings, the suspicion of ileal and pancreatic lymphomatous involvement was posed (Fig.4).The patient underwent a colonoscopy (Fig.5), during which some histological samples of the ileal lesion were taken: pathological analysis obtained on these tissue specimens confirmed the diagnosis of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of the ileum (subtype: diffuse large B-cell/Immunophenotype CD20+, Bcl-6+, CD3-) (Fig.6). After 4 months of chemotherapy regimen, control CT showed reduction of both pancreatic and ileal involvement, confirming the diagnosis of pancreatic lymphoma (Fig.7).

A 47-year-old man presented with a week history of epigastric pain. He had no sign of obstructive jaundice. On examination, a vague mass was felt at the epigastric region. Blood investigation showed raised serum amylase.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Computed Tomography (CT) shows a large hypodense pancreatic head mass with little enhancement. The mass encases the gastroduodenal artery and surrounding peripancreatic vessels without causing occlusion or thrombosis. The common bile duct is encased but there is no pancreatic or biliary ductal dilatation. Minimal peripancreatic lymph nodes were noted. No other associated lymphadenopathy was found in the rest of the abdomen or pelvis. Overall findings are suspicious of pancreatic lymphoma.As this was a potentially resectable disease if it was a case of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, the likelihood of primary pancreatic lymphoma had been conveyed to the hepatobiliary surgeon. The decision of biopsy was made after a multidisciplinary team discussion.Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy was then performed and histopathological examination (HPE) revealed the diagnosis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the pancreas. The patient was thus started with chemotherapy.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 13-month-old female infant is brought to consultation due to repeated spastic seizures during the 2 previous months, without loss of consciousness, which have progressively become more frequent, now occurring up to 5-6 times a day. The patient is initiated on anti-epileptic drugs and a cranial MRI is performed.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Initial MRI (figure 1) demonstrates a cystic lesion located in the left anterior temporal pole with slight T2/FLAIR hyperintensity of the adjacent parenchyma. No contrast enhancement is visible. The lesion is considered suggestive of a low-grade glioma or ganglioglioma.The patient is followed with consecutive, yearly MRI scans, without significant change in between.Follow-up MRI performed 4 years later (figure 2) identifies the same lesion, of similar size, but which now shows a large, intensely-enhancing extraaxial component in the adjacent skull-base with fine dural tail. This extraaxial component, which represents meningeal involvement is highly suggestive of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.The tumour is resected (left temporal lobectomy) and pathology confirms a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplastic characteristics and leptomeningeal infiltration.Seizures are correctly controlled after surgery and anticonvulsant drugs withdrawn.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Female 26 years old patient with a 5 year history of partial complex seizures

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Patient with a 5 year history of partial complex seizures and decreased right eye vision since childhood. Neurologic examination demonstrated bilateral homonymous hemianopsia.Computed Tomography (CT) scan disclosed a left pasagittal mass, partially cystic and partially solid. The cystic component was localized  infratentorially and the solid part was supratentorial. After contrast administration the solid part of the tumour showed homogeneous enhancement. Obstructive hydrocephalus was also noted.On Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) the cystic component was hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images, following the signal characteristics of CSF. The solid part was isointense with gray matter on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images with marked enhancement with gadolinium. Extensive vasogenic edema was found supratentorially in the left cerebral hemisphere, surrounding the solid tumour component.At surgery a subtotal resection was achieved, part of the solid component could not be removed. At four months follow-up MRI study no progression of the residual tumour was found.Histologically the tumour was composed of fusiform cells mixed with dense cellular areas dense with large, hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and multinucleated cells. A few cells were partly surrounded by a discontinuous external lamina that occasionally invaginated deeply into the cytoplasm and formed pseudoinclusions reminiscent of fat droplets. No necrosis or mitosis was identified.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A patient with a 2-year history of temporal lobe epilepsy was referred for a cranial MRI study.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
A patient with a 2-year history of temporal lobe epilepsy was referred for a cranial MRI study. This was performed on a 1.5T MRI scanner, with SE T1-weighted, FSE T2-weighted, FLAIR, and post-contrast SE T1-weighted sequences in the sagittal, axial and coronal planes. A mass lesion with solid and cystic components was detected in the right temporo-insular lobe with extension towards the thalamus and basal ganglia. The location of the mass was in cortical grey matter and subcortical white matter, with mild peripheral oedema. The cystic component of the mass was hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and was associated with mild peripheral contrast enhancement. The solid component of the mass was isointense on T1-weighted and intermediate to hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and associated with an intermediate degree of contrast enhancement. The patient underwent a surgical resection of the lesion with subsequent histological confirmation of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 3-year-old-girl presented with headaches and partial complex seizures for a few months. There were findings suggestive of increased intracranial pressure.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
An extensive mass located in the left parietal region with ill-defined borders was demonstrated, with involvement of the left thalamus. The mass had heterogeneous signal intensity, predominantly isointense on T1WI and T2WI, with cystic/necrotic zones and bleeding in the posterior portion of the tumour. It demonstrated mild / moderate perilesional oedema predominantly in the upper parietal region, which demonstrated restriction of diffusion. The lesion impinged on the body of the left lateral ventricle, causing moderate dilation of the left occipital and temporal horns. On T1FS+Gd the lesion demonstrated moderate heterogeneous enhancement, mainly posteriorly. Diffusion-weighted sequences showed restricted diffusion in the perilesional oedema. On spectroscopy, there is a marked increase in the choline peak, with a decrease in the N-acetylaspartate and Cr peaks (tumoral pattern).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Initial ultrasound examination with fine-needle aspiration was done, with inconclusive results. A neck computed tomography (CT) with and without contrast was performed for characterisation and revealed a well-defined 9 cm soft tissue mass in the right infrahyoid carotid space with extension to the upper mediastinum, displacing the visceral space medially (Fig. 1). The lesion also displaced the internal jugular vein anteriorly and the common carotid vessel posteriorly, encasing this vessel without compressing it. After contrast administration the lesion had mild peripheral enhancement and small, central, hypoenhancing areas. There were no calcifications. Several prominent lymph nodes were identified on the right anterior cervical space, but no other lesions were identified.On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this lesion exhibited spontaneously low T1 and high T2-STIR signal, with mild enhancement after contrast administration (Fig. 2). A PET-CT was performed outside of the authors�� hospital institution, which showed avid FDG uptake associated with the mass.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A previously healthy young woman complained of right lower chest discomfort for 10 months.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient presented with a 10-month history of right lower chest discomfort. Physical examination and laboratory findings were normal.Chest radiography revealed an ovoid mass in the right paracardiac region (Fig. 1a). MR imaging revealed a well-defined mass in the right cardiophrenic region. The mass was slightly hyperintense to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images, and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted and enhanced T1-weighted images (Figs 1b-1e).During surgery, a 5cm encapsulated mass originating from the right paracardiac parietal pleura, with blood supplies from the pleural arteries, was found. Adhesion of the mass to the adjacent pericardium, right hemidiaphragm, and right middle and lower lobes was also noted. Radical tumour resection was performed.Microscopically, the lesion was composed of germinal follicles with hyalinised vessels surrounded by onion-like layers of small lymphocytes and prominent vascular stroma in the interfollicular tissue with lymphocytic infiltration. The adjacent lung and pericardial tissues appeared normal. The final diagnosis was Castleman disease of the hyaline-vascular subtype.The patient has been followed-up for 8 years with no further chest discomfort.

A 45-year-old man complained of an abdominal mass for one year. By specialized examination we found the mass had poorly mobility. He had no history of injury, previous surgery or any relevant family history.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Abdominal ultrasound revealed mixed echo lumps in the right part of the pelvis, short clavite colour blood flow signal in the internal and blood signal. Upper and lower gastro-intestinal endoscopic studies confirmed the presence of no ulcerated gastric lesion (caecum, transverse and sigmoid colon). Abdomino-pelvic contrast-enhanced CT showed an iso-dense mass of about 11 cm in diameter in the pelvic cavity, the centre of which was punctate calcification and multiple patchy necrosis areas. At arterial phase, the tumour showed a non-homogeneous hypodense mass including variously enhanced scattered patches. At portal phases, the degree and extent of enhancement of the tumour gradually increased. No enlarged lymph nodes were present.MRI detected a well-defined solid mass with T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense and restricted diffusion.Laparoscopic mass excision was performed and pathological diagnosis of Hyaline-vascular Castleman��s disease was made.

Physical examination showed signs compatible with acute abdomen syndrome and the laboratory results demonstrated leucocytosis and a high ESR.The patient reported that she was pregnant and had tried to perform an abortion using an iron tool, three days previously.Pelvic US demonstrated bilateral solid adnexal masses and a small volume of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas.In face of these findings it was considered necessary to perform a pelvic MRI examination.The MRI examination confirmed the US findings, showing a left adnexal mass with a convolved aspect, measuring 10 cm. This was heterogeneous on T1-weighted images and of medium intensity on T2-weighted images. A mass of the same aspect was present on right-hand side.All the lesions showed high enhancement of the wall after paramagnetic contrast administration. There was ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 47-year-old lady with no significant past medical history other than previous Mirena intra-uterine device (IUD) insertion presented to the emergency department with a one week history of severe suprapubic and left iliac fossa pain. The patient was pyrexial (38.2��C) and had raised inflammatory markers (WCC=15.1, CRP=260).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis in portal venous phase identified a 7cm multi-located collection in the left iliac fossa with wall thickening of adjacent bowel loops and a little free fluid. The left ovary was not seen separately. This was reported as an abscess, either tubo-ovarian or diverticular in origin. The patient was treated with high dose intra-venous antibiotics, but failed to show any improvement in pain or pyrexia after 4 days. A trans-vaginal ultrasound examination was performed, which showed a persistent complex collection involving the left ovary with some wall thickening of closely related sigmoid colon. The intra-uterine coil was noted in satisfactory position.Subsequent laparoscopic surgery revealed a tubo-ovarian abscess with no evidence of diverticulitis but secondary inflammatory reaction of adjacent bowel loops. Coil removal, abscess drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy resulted in eventual clearance of the infection. Follow-up ultrasound 7 months after treatment confirmed full recovery.

Patient with intense abdomino-pelvic pain, fever and long history of sexually transmitted infections. Diffuse inflammatory state of left adnexal region at ultrasound examination.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient, an adult female, presented to our first aid unit complaining intense pelvic pain, lasting from three days. Objective examination evidenced relevant temperature alteration (39��) withintense pain referred to lower abdomen and pelvic region; furthermore anamnesis revealed long lasting history of sexually acquired diseases. An ultrasound scan of lower abdomen and pelvis wasperformed, but showed not specific signs of inflammation in the left adnexal region, whilst ovaries were not correctly visualized due to intense small bowel meteorism and patient's miscooperation.The patient was admitted to our surgical division for observation and the following day underwent MRI scan of lower abdomen and pelvic region for better evaluation of the echographic findings. Aftersmall bowel preparation (PEG), we performed T2-weighted HASTE and T1-weighted FLASH sequences (before and after intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA). The protocol was even completed by T2-weighted TSEhi-res sequences. MRI evidenced in both salpinx remarkable swelling and presence of septations and fluid levels, typical findings of chronic inflammation. In the pelvic hollow were either presentmultiple and partially confluent collections, septed and with thickened walls. Even the loco-regional portion of small bowel showed reactive appearance.

A 37-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with acute pelvic pain in the left iliac fossa, that had begun 6 hours before, and fever (38.2��C). She had a past history of two caesarean sections. Laboratory investigations showed a C-reactive protein of 25.1 mg/dl and white blood cell count of 21.3x103/ml (neutrophils 84%).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Transvaginal ultrasound detected a complex and painful mass in left pelvis; it was 8 cm in diameter with thickened peripheral wall and internal septa and a simil-fluid content with a lot of internal echoes (Fig. 1). Left ovary was not recognisable.A CT examination performed with i.v. injection of contrast media confirmed the presence of a left tubo-adnexal multiloculated complex mass with solid-cystic components and contrast-enhanced peripheral wall and septa (Fig. 2a). Uterus was dislocated towards the right pelvis. The contralateral ovary appeared normal. No free peritoneal fluid was detected. Cranially the mass was adjacent to sigmoid colon and the sigmoid wall was thickened with hyperdense appearance of perivisceral fat (Fig. 2b). Diverticula were seen both in sigmoid and in descending colon (Fig. 2c).The suggested diagnosis based on imaging findings was left Fallopian tube abscess caused by a sigmoid diverticulitis. The surgeons during laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis and performed Hartman procedure and hysteroannessiectomy.

The patient presented with abdominal pain and weight loss of 3 weeks' duration.Two weeks previously her Intra-Uterine Devive (IUD) was removed because it was displaced.The routine pelvic sonography showed a left adnexaL complex cystic mass.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient, gravida III, para I, presented with a low, stabbing abdominal pain and weight loss for 3 weeks' duration. No vaginal discharge was reported. There was no significant past medical history apart from the removal 2 weeks previously of a caudally displaced intrauterine device (IUD). At this time, a routine pelvic sonography showed a left adnexal complex cystic mass, a CT scan was performed and the patient was referred with the presupposed diagnosis of a tumoral lesion.Physical examination revealed a left adnexal mass and a tender subcutaneous right abdominal wall mass with acute inflammatory signs. Laboratory parameters were normal, with tumoral markers within normal limits. Imaging work-up of the patient consisted of a MRI examination, which revealed a complex cystic mass of the left adnexa, compatible with oophoropyosalpingitis; pelvic peritonitis; and a right abdominal subcutaneous collection/abscess. Percutaneous drainage of the abdominal wall abscess was performed. Culture was positive for Bacteroides fragilis, which allowed adequate intravenous antibiotic coverage. After a few days the patient underwent a left adnexectomy, a right salpingoplasty and had an omental nodule removed. During surgery the greater omentum was found to be adherent to the anterior abdominal wall that had on the right a spigelian hernia through which the infection spread between the left adnexa and the abdominal wall. The pathologic diagnosis was chronic oophorosalpingitis and periadnexal peritonitis and the omental nodule was an abscess.

Medical history included several cardiovascular risk factors, obliterating atheromatous disease of the lower limbs.Serum troponin I and electrocardiographic findings were consistent with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Early coronary angiography identified a critical stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA), which was treated by stenting. 24 hours later the patient experienced haemodynamic shock, intra-aortic balloon pump was positioned, repeated coronary angiography positioned a second RCA stent just proximally to the previous one.During further deterioration with severe shock and metabolic acidosis, echocardiography detected appearance of pericardial effusion. Emergency multidetector CT (Fig.1) showed hemopericardium, contrast medium flowing through a full-thickness discontinuity of the left ventricle (LV) lateral wall consistent with complete myocardial rupture.Immediate cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation was performed. After pericardiotomy, partially clotted blood was removed from the pericardial cavity and active bleeding from the LV free wall was detected in the territory of the obtuse marginal branch. Surrounded by friable necrotic myocardium, the laceration was repaired by mattress suture. The patient eventually recovered after intensive care including dialysis to treat acute kidney injury.

The patient promptly underwent to successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation of proximal left descending artery.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Three days after PCI he referred fatigue and dyspnea so that an echocardiography was performed depicting pericardial effusion and severe thinning of left ventricular apex wall with a suspiciousmalacic area in the inferior apical segments. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (MR) examination was requested due to the hypothesis of an impending heart rupture. Cardiac MR was performed with respiratoryand electrocardiographic trigger and with Gadolinium contrast administration. The examination confirmed the presence of myocardial thinning of heart apex (1 to 3 millimetres), especially of theanterior and inferior segments (figure 1), with high signal intensity on T2 weighted images (figure 2) referable to oedema. At this latter level, cardiac MR showed a distension of the epicardium(sub-epicardial aneurysm?) with no clear complete recognition of myocardial layer, compatible with myocardial impending rupture (figure 3). Moreover, during the injection of Gadolinium, an area ofhypo-enhancement was present with contrast extrusion in the epicardium (figure 4). Delayed enhancement images showed a transmural anterior and apical infarction with areas of microvascularobstruction and with no evidence of clot neither thrombus (figure 5). Pericardial effusion was also present.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Vaginal examination palpated a soft mass, corresponding to a sizeable hypoanechoic collection on ultrasound (Fig. 1), which was interpreted as vaginal stump haematoma by gynaecologists but doubled in volume 72 hours later. Laboratory assays revealed markedly abnormal urinalysis with raised C-reactive protein (329 mg/l). Then, urgent multidetector CT (Fig. 2) depicted a large fluid-attenuation collection cranial to the urinary bladder and vagina, partially opacified in the excretory phase, consistent with urinoma from incomplete right ureteral laceration.Conservative treatment included ureteral stenting and prolonged catheterization. Two days later, unenhanced CT (Fig. 3) showed minimal size decrease of the urinoma. Meanwhile, pathology revealed an intra-myometrial proliferation consistent with endometrial stromal sarcoma.One month later, follow-up CT (Fig. 4a, b) showed near-complete resolution of the urinoma, ipsilateral development of abnormal nephrographic appearance and of enhancing urothelial thickening suggesting pyeloureteritis and pyelonephritis.

A subsequent CT was performed with intravenous and oral contrast medium. Thisdemonstrated a large retroperitoneal fluid collection with a thin enhancing wall in addition to ascites (figure 1A). The following day she returned to the department for drainage of the fluidcollection. A repeat CT was performed without any additional contrast medium (figures 1B,2). Interestingly, contrast enhancement was demonstrated within the fluid collection previously identified.The attenuation of this collection was identical to that within the bladder. Oblique sagittal reconstructions demonstrated that the collection communicated with the right ureter (figure 3). An 8Frpigtail catheter was inserted into the collection and fluid similar in appearance to urine was withdrawn. Biochemical analysis of this closely resembled urine from the bladder (drain creatinine =245��mol l-1, urea = 6.0mmol l-1; catheter creatinine = 396��mol l-1, urea = 8.8 mmol l-1). The patient subsequently underwent an anterograde pyelogramwhich confirmed the presence of a distal right ureteric leak into a urinoma (figure 4). A 6Fr double pigtail stent was inserted antegradely into the right ureter. Her symptoms resolved and afollow-up nephrostogram confirmed that the leak had sealed at which time the nephrostomy was removed. Her subsequent post-operative course was unremarkable.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
Male patient with vague, long-standing history of urolithiasis and benign prostatic hypertrophy, admitted to Emergency Department with acute right flank pain, without associated macroscopic haematuria nor significantly abnormal laboratory tests.Sufficiently preserved renal function (estimated Glomerular Filtration rate 65 ml/min using MDRD equation).

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
With the patient still in Emergency, urgent unenhanced CT was requested to investigate suspected renal colic due to urolithiasis and exclude possible alternative diagnoses. After catheterisation, the bladder appeared contracted with severe circumferential mural thickening and multiple calculi, consistent with chronic urinary retention due to prostatic enlargement. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis was observed, associated with fluid-like effusion surrounding the renal pelvis and proximal ureter.Further investigation with enhanced CT was performed: after contrast administration, fair nephrographic phase and urinary opacification were observed bilaterally. The right-sided peri- and posterior pararenal fluid extravasation became strongly hyperdense in the excretory phase corresponding to extravasated urine, allowing diagnosis of retroperitoneal urinoma.Completion with 3D volume rendering images allowed visualisation of size and shape of the urinoma, with its spatial relationship to the kidney, pelvis and proximal ureter.After 10 days of conservative treatment including antibiotics, perinephric fluid collection was no more identifiable at follow-up ultrasound.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
The patient presented with a two-week history of mild left hip pain during walking and especially after prolonged sitting. There was no history of previous disease or symptoms, except for left renal colic. Clinical examination revealed a palpable mass in the left pelvis.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The patient presented with left hip pain which became more prominent during walking or after prolonged sitting. The pain had lasted two weeks. The symptomatology was mild, without significant restriction of her general activities. There was no history of previous disease or symptoms, except for left renal colic, with four episodes over 2 years, the last one having occurred 2 years previously. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, while clinical examination revealed a palpable mass in the left pelvis.Ultrasonographic examination showed high grade dilatation of the left urinary collecting system, decreased thickness of the renal parenchyma and a thick-walled cystic mass indistinguishable from the left psoas muscle. Computer tomography demonstrated a massive enlargement of the left psoas muscle exhibiting extensive hypodensity in the central area. The lesion extended from the level of the left kidney's lower pole into the pelvis towards the inguinal ligament (Fig. 1). No significant enhancement was shown after intravenous contrast medium administration. High grade hydronephrosis of the left kidney was observed and dilatation of the left ureter down to the pelvis, where a subcentimetre stone-like lesion was demonstrated in close proximity to the enlarged iliopsoas muscle.  Multiple mildly enlarged retroperitoneal, mesenteric and left inguinal lymph nodes were also identified. Tc-99 renal scintigraphy revealed that the left kidney contributed 11% to the total renal function and the right one 89%.Percutaneous aspiration of the lesion was performed under CT guidance, using an anterior approach; this yielded a pale yellow fluid which proved to be sterile urine. Consequently, an 8F catheter was positioned within the cystic lesion. CT images acquired during drainage, without oral administration of contrast medium, demonstrated well the radiopaque calculus in the middle third segment of the left ureter (Fig. 2). Radiological evaluation following administration of contrast medium through the catheter on the third postprocedural day revealed opacification of a cavity communicating with the ureter through a fistula (Fig. 3). The patient underwent left nephrectomy and the drainage catheter remained in the cavity for 14 days. Recovery was uneventful.

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 43-year-old drug addicted male patient, in Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) and with clinical history of viral hepatitis (HCV+, HBV+) presented with haematuria, pyuria and septic fever. An ultrasound examination, made in another center, showed a perirenal fluid hypoechoic collection. The patient came to our department for a Computer Tomography (CT) evaluation.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
Abdominal CT showed a marked subcapsular fluid collection (APxLLxCC:11x14x22cm) in left perirenal space, displacing forwards the omolateral renal parenchyma [Fig. 1].The formation, with internal septations and peripherical wall-enhancement, was medially in contact with omolateral psoas muscle, aorta [Fig.1d-f] and major renal artery.An ultra-delayed phase acquisition (30min) showed abundant iodinate urine shedding in the context of the described collection [Fig. 2], demonstrating a tear of the intermediate calyx in its papillary region, feeding the urinoma [Fig. 3].The ureter appeared slightly compressed, but still patent [Fig. 3].A percutaneous pig-tail drainage was performed and follow-up CT showed the collection almost completely drained in retroperitoneal medial region, while the posterior component still remained in place.A month later, CT showed air inside the collection previously described, suggesting a retroperitoneal abscess [Fig. 4a, c].Air content was also detected inside the abdominal wall, where the drainage was placed, associated with non-homogeneous thickening of the soft tissues (cutaneous fistula) [Fig. 4b, d].

--- CLINICAL HISTORY ---
A 12-year-old boy presented with an acute abdomen and haemodynamic instability following a quad bike accident. An emergency CT of the abdomen and pelvis were performed after the initialresuscitation.

--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---
The CT study demonstrated liver and splenic lacerations, a right-sided adrenal haematoma and a fractured right kidney. There was a haemoperitoneum and a right perirenal haematoma. The duodeum andcolon anterior to the right kidney were thick walled and oedematous. In addition, the patient sustained bilateral femoral fractures, which required surgical fixation. His abdominal injuries weremanaged conservatively, but he remained haemodynamically unstable and a repeat CT examination was requested. The second CT study (obtained, fortuitously in the excretory phase) showed extravasationof contrast from a lacerated right pelviureteric junction, into a surrounding urinoma. Contrast was seen tracking down into the pelvis. The patient was immediately commenced on antibiotic theraphy.Fourteen days after admission, the patient developed a pyrexia and right-side abdominal pain. A CT examination showed the urinoma had developed into an abscess, that extended into the right iliopsoasmuscle. There was also a sub-capsular component to the abscess, (not shown) which compressed the upper pole of the right kidney. Under US guidance, a 10F pigtail drain was placed into the abscesscavity. A total of 160mls of pus was aspirated. A limited IVU perfromed on Day 28 confirmed a persistent contrast leak from the torn right pelvi-ureteric junction. Following this study, the patientwas taken for surgical repair of the injury.
