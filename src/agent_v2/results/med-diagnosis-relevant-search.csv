Case number 19087,"19087:Original case - Shows classic bear paw sign, staghorn calculus, renal enlargement, perinephric inflammation, and non-functioning kidney - demonstrates complete diagnostic picture of diffuse XGP;18308:Clear bear paw sign with staghorn calculus and perinephric fat stranding - shows key diagnostic imaging features including dilated calyces surrounded by thin parenchymal rim;19103:Demonstrates bear paw sign in bifid ureter with staghorn calculus - shows diagnostic features in anatomical variant and perirenal inflammatory extension;17200:Classic presentation with staghorn calculus on radiograph, renal enlargement, cortical thinning, and perinephric inflammatory changes - shows typical clinical and imaging triad;14129:Shows staghorn calculus with water-attenuation cavities and peripelvic fat stranding - demonstrates chronic destructive process with fatty xanthomatous deposits;17028:Clear bear paw sign with air-fluid levels in dilated calyces, perinephric fat stranding, and no contrast excretion - shows advanced diffuse form with extrarenal extension;2523:Advanced diffuse form with contracted kidney, staghorn calculus, and extensive perinephric lipomatous expansion - demonstrates late-stage XGP with replacement lipomatosis;2802:Bilateral XGP case showing renal enlargement with lobulated masses replacing parenchyma - demonstrates rare bilateral presentation and MR imaging characteristics;19037:Shows bear paw sign with fat-density areas (xanthomas), perirenal fat stranding, and staging according to Malek classification - demonstrates comprehensive CT features;9344:Bilateral staghorn calculi with extensive perinephric fatty tissue and psoas muscle extension - shows advanced chronic XGP with extrarenal complications",10,2026-02-02T20:17:48.470282
Case number 19172,"19172:Primary case showing classic features: thin central septum dividing uterus into two hemicavities, placental implantation on septum, fetus extending across septum - demonstrates all key diagnostic features for Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation;11882:Shows septate uterus with placenta previa - demonstrates association between uterine septum and abnormal placental implantation, helps understand risk factors and complications;5700:Bicornuate pregnancy case - important for differential diagnosis, shows how to distinguish bicornuate from septate uterus based on fundal cleft and external contour;10893:Uterus didelphys case - demonstrates complete separation of uterine horns, helps differentiate septate uterus (internal septum) from didelphys (complete duplication);16525:Bicornuate uterus with pregnancy - shows two distinct cornua, helps distinguish external fundal cleft of bicornuate vs internal septum of septate uterus;9850:Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome - demonstrates complex Mullerian anomalies with renal associations, helps understand spectrum of uterine malformations;18774:Unicornuate uterus case - shows single uterine horn, important for differential diagnosis against septate uterus which has two hemicavities;9066:Juvenile cystic adenomyosis - demonstrates differential diagnosis for uterine masses that could be confused with septate uterus features;18328:Interstitial ectopic pregnancy - mentions cornual pregnancy in septate/bicornuate uterus, shows importance of identifying uterine anomalies in ectopic pregnancies;12660:Uterine rupture post-septoplasty - demonstrates complications of uterine septum surgery, shows importance of monitoring septate uterus pregnancies",10,2026-02-02T20:49:34.778137
