Histopathological examination showed features consistent with sclerosing lymphocytic mastitis (dense lymphocytic infiltrate, collagenised stroma, thickened basal membrane). The patient had chronic hyperglycemia and the lesion completely resolved with glycemic control. This aligns with lymphocytic mastopathy, which is also known as diabetic mastopathy, commonly affecting premenopausal women and associated with glucose metabolism abnormalities."
