Ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed extensive stromal fibrosis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and over 50 IgG4-positive plasma cells per HPF, which is diagnostic for IgG4-related breast disease. This rare condition mimics malignancy but is benign, characterized by dense IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates. The histological findings specifically match IgG4-related disease rather than the other options (invasive carcinoma, papillomatosis, DCIS, or lymphoproliferative disorder)."

She denied any relevant associated symptoms.\n\n\n### Question\nBased on the clinical history and imaging findings above, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n### Options\nA. IgG4-related breast disease\nB. Invasive ductal carcinoma\nC. Papillomatosis\nD. Mass-forming ductal carcinoma in situ\nE. Lymphoproliferative disorder\n\nPlease analyze this case and select the correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E).\nUse the research_tools.py script to plan your research, query the database, and submit your answer.\n",
