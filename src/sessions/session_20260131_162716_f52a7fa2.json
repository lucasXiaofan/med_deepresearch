Endoscopic third ventriculostomy relieved the pressure symptoms of hydrocephalus and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Further neurosurgery was not possible and the patient underwent radical radiotherapy with good response.\n\n\n### Question\nBased on the clinical history and imaging findings above, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n### Options\nA. Meningioma\nB. Dermoid\nC. Tectal Glioma\nD. Intracranial Germ cell tumour\nE. Pineoblastoma\n\nPlease analyze this case and select the correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E).\nUse the research_tools.py script to plan your research, query the database, and submit your answer.\n",
