She presented with a bilobed abdominal contour seen externally as two distinct bulges with a central vertical depression. No earlier imaging had been done.\n\n\n### Question\nBased on the clinical history and imaging findings above, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n### Options\nA. Gravid bicornuate uterus with intercornual communication\nB. Gravid didelphys uterus with partial fusion\nC. Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation\nD. Gravid arcuate uterus with exaggerated indentation\nE. Gravid uterus with intrauterine synechiae or band\n\nPlease analyze this case and select the correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E).\nUse the research_tools.py script to plan your research, query the database, and submit your answer.\n",
