# Radiologist Case Review — Relevance Assessment

_Generated: 2026-02-22 14:46_  
_Cases in this document: 6_

## Purpose

This document contains a set of Eurorad cases and their AI-retrieved relevant reference cases. For each target case you will see:

- The full target case text (clinical history, imaging findings, discussion)
- A set of retrieved relevant reference cases with full text
- GPT-5.2's automated relevance rating and reasoning for each reference case

## Relevance Grading Rubric

Please rate each relevant case on a **1–5** scale:

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **5 — Highly relevant** | Same pathology, same organ/location, same imaging modality; imaging features directly mirror the target case and would strongly guide the diagnosis |
| **4 — Relevant** | Same pathology family or strong imaging analogy; provides meaningful diagnostic support even if minor differences in location or patient demographics |
| **3 — Partially relevant** | Related differential or useful contrast case; provides supporting evidence but would not alone drive the diagnosis |
| **2 — Weakly relevant** | Tangentially related; useful mainly for exclusion or academic comparison |
| **1 — Not relevant** | Different pathology, different mechanism; unlikely to help a radiologist reach the target diagnosis |

**Grading dimensions to consider:**
1. **Pathology match** — same diagnosis vs. differential vs. unrelated
2. **Imaging feature overlap** — do the key imaging findings align (signal characteristics, enhancement pattern, morphology)?
3. **Organ / location** — same site vs. analogous site vs. different organ
4. **Clinical context** — age, sex, presentation — do they overlap meaningfully?
5. **Diagnostic utility** — would seeing this case help a radiologist identify the target condition?

## Questions for the Radiologist

For **each case** in this document, please answer the following:

1. **Discriminating imaging features**: Which specific imaging features are most discriminating for reaching the correct diagnosis? (e.g. signal intensity, enhancement pattern, morphology, location)

2. **Image-reading necessity**: For this case, is direct image viewing essential — or is the written imaging findings text sufficient for a radiologist to identify the correct diagnosis? Please explain why.

3. **When images are essential vs. text is enough**:
   - *Cases where you must read the images*: What types of findings or diagnostic distinctions genuinely require looking at the actual images rather than reading the written report?
   - *Cases where imaging findings text is enough*: What types of cases can be reliably diagnosed from the written imaging findings alone, without viewing the images?

4. **GPT-5.2 reasoning check**: For each relevant case listed, does GPT-5.2's stated rationale correctly identify the key imaging link to the target case? Is the "most important signal" clinically accurate and meaningful?

5. **Your relevance rating**: Using the rubric above, assign your own 1–5 score for each relevant case. Note any disagreements with GPT-5.2's rating and explain why.

6. **Framework for relevance judgment**: What is your general framework for deciding whether a reference case would help a radiologist diagnose a new Eurorad case? Which dimensions matter most — pathology match, imaging modality, organ/location, clinical context, or something else?

_Please apply the questions above to each case below._

**Clinical History:**
The patient was referred by the GP to the ED for thoracic pain irradiating to the left arm.There were multiple cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, 7 pack-years, positive family history).A clinical question: Stenosis?

**Imaging Findings:**
Rare congenital variant: mono coronary originating from the non-coronary cusp.The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) courses from the right atrioventricular (AV) groove anterior of the pulmonary trunk to the anterior interventricular groove (prepulmonic course).The left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) courses posterior to the aorta from the right AV groove to the left AV groove (retro-aortic course).No interatrial "malignant" course. No acute angle takeoff, slitlike orifice nor an intramural segment. No significant coronary stenosis.

**Discussion:**
A. Multiple courses of anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) are known: retro-aortic, prepulmonic, transseptal and interarterial. [1]Of these four variants, only the interarterial course is a cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD), the exact pathophysiology is not elucidated, because a normal pulmonary artery is not likely to exert enough pressure to occlude an interarterial coronary artery. [2] Right ACAOS is more frequent than left ACAOS, but has a weaker association with SCD.An intramural segment, another associated anatomical variant, is probably the most predisposing factor to sudden cardiac death. [3]It is defined as a proximal segment of the coronary artery located in the 'media' of the aortic wall without an intervening adventitia. [4]B. Ischaemia (an…

**Differential Diagnosis:**
Mono coronary originating from the non-coronary cusp without malignant features (SCD)Right anomalous origin of coronary artery from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course without intramural segmentRight anomalous origin from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course and intramural segmentLeft anomalous origin of coronary artery from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course without intramural segmentLeft anomalous origin from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course and intramural segment

### Relevant Case 1: #14073  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/14073](https://www.eurorad.org/case/14073)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Demonstrates how altered coronary dominance and retro-aortic supply can mimic or compensate for missing vessels, but lacks a single-ostium mono-coronary anatomy.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This case involves congenital absence of a coronary artery with compensatory superdominant supply, which is conceptually related to congenital coronary variants but differs from a true mono-coronary origin from a single ostium.

**Clinical History:** Case A: 57-year-old male patient presented with atypical chest pain. CT coronary angiography was performed to rule out significant coronary artery stenosis.Case B: 67-year-old male patient with chest pain and exertional dyspnoea. Positive treadmill test. Previous history of similar episodes.

**Imaging Findings:** Case A: Calcium score of 150 with predominant calcifications along the LAD. Complete absence of the left circumflex artery (LCX) with no vessel visualised in the superior aspect of the left atrio-ventricular groove. The RCA was superdominant giving rise to the PDA and PLV branches along with extension along the base of the heart to the inferior aspect of the left atrio-ventricular groove supplying the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Multilevel mixed plaques noted along the LAD without signif…

**Final Diagnosis:** Case A: Absent left circumflex arteryCase B: Absent right coronary artery

### Relevant Case 2: #4847  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/4847](https://www.eurorad.org/case/4847)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Benign anterior/prepulmonic course without slit-like ostium or intramural segment supporting non-malignant classification.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Shows a single-ostium coronary anomaly with an anomalous prepulmonic course and absence of malignant features, closely paralleling the benign course assessment required in the target case, though involving the RCA rather than a mono-coronary system.

**Clinical History:** A 57 year old, male, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and IGT, with stress-ECG showing abnormal findings, we found an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery.

**Imaging Findings:** A 57 year old, male, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and IGT, with stress-ECG showing abnormal findings underwent coronary CT angiography. The patient referred about three previous episodesof chest pain in last two years, once lasting longer than 15 minutes and with radiation to the mandible, always related to exertion. The patient had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years but hestopped at 45. Blood examination demonstrated abnormal lipids (LDL 170 mg/dl, HDL 30 mg/dl) and impaired g…

**Final Diagnosis:** Left CAD and left Valsalva sinus right coronary abnormal origin.

### Relevant Case 3: #16640  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/16640](https://www.eurorad.org/case/16640)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Interarterial course of the left main between aorta and pulmonary trunk as a defining malignant feature absent in the target case.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Provides a clear contrast case of a malignant interarterial course arising from a common origin, useful for differentiating high-risk ACAOS patterns from the benign configuration in the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 48-year-old patient with hyperlipidaemia and a long term history of stable angina pectoris was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of acute chest pain and dyspnoea. Initial ECG showed sinus bradycardia with no signs of ischaemia and the patient was admitted for further tests. Cardiac catheterisation and a cardiac CT were performed which revealed a rare coronary anomaly.

**Imaging Findings:** Initially the calcium scoring showed no evidence of coronary calcifications, with a resulting Agatson score of 0.CT angiography performed subsequently revealed a common origin of both right coronary artery (RCA) and left main trunk (LM), with both arising from the right sinus of Valsalva. There was an anomalous course of the LM to the left between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk (interarterial course). After the bifurcation of unusually long LM into its branches, the left anterior descending a…

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant course of LM with right coronary dominance

### Relevant Case 4: #11134  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/11134](https://www.eurorad.org/case/11134)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Slit-like opening and acute angulation at origin—key malignant signs not present in the target mono-coronary case.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Illustrates malignant coronary anomaly with slit-like ostium and acute angulation, serving as an important comparator to highlight which dangerous features are specifically excluded in the target diagnosis.

**Clinical History:** 60-year-old female patient with complaints of vague chest pain. No history of diabetes or hypertension. CT coronary angiogram was advised.

**Imaging Findings:** The total calcium score was '0'. The right coronary and left main coronary artery showed a common origin from left aortic sinus. Anomalous course of right coronary artery (RCA) noted anteriorly between aorta and main pulmonary artery (inter arterial course). RCA is small in calibre with slit-like opening and acute angulation at its origin. Posterior descending artery (PDA) arising from left circumflex artery (LCX) suggest left coronary dominance. Rest of the coronary arteries are normal in cours…

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant coronary anomaly of RCA with left coronary dominance

### Relevant Case 5: #5946  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/5946](https://www.eurorad.org/case/5946)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** RCA coursing between aorta and pulmonary artery, defining an interarterial malignant pattern.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Demonstrates a classic malignant interarterial RCA anomaly, relevant mainly as a differential exclusion rather than direct support for the target benign diagnosis.

**Clinical History:** The authors present a case of an aberrant right coronary artery (RCA) (interarterial or malignant type) at a 64-years-old patient, presented with symptoms of unstable angina. Image findings at64-multidetector CT coronary angiography are described.

**Imaging Findings:** A 64-year-old male patient was presented to our department for a 64-slices CT coronary angiography examination due to unstable angina. The patient was thoroughly informed about the examinationtechnique and gave oral consent. A 64-multislice CT scanner (Aquilion, Toshiba Co) and a Vitrea 2 version 3.9 workstation (Toshiba Co) were used for the examination and image post-processingrespectively. Right coronary artery originated from the left aortic sinus, from separate ostium from the left coronary…

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant or interarterial right coronary artery

### Relevant Case 6: #6587  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/6587](https://www.eurorad.org/case/6587)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Interarterial course with malignant potential emphasizing the absence of such a course in the target case.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Another example of malignant interarterial coronary anatomy, useful for comparison but not directly supportive of the benign mono-coronary variant seen in the target case.

**Clinical History:** Heavy smoker, anxious patient with a significant parenthood for CAD (his father died for a heart attack at 52 y/o) and hypertension (SCORE system 1% 10-years risk of fatal cardiovascular events) whopresented asymptomatic.

**Imaging Findings:** The patient underwent an echocardiography which turned out to be negative. A 64-slice cardio-CT was performed since his familiarity that depicted a malignant right coronary (RCA) anomaly origin and course. The RCA arose from the left coronary sinus and had an inter-arterial course. No other signs of coronary artery disease were found. Due to the potential malignancy of this coronary anomaly (CA) the patient underwent a stress-test which showed no signs of ischemic disease.

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant inter-arterial right coronary artery anomaly.

### Case 10790  
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/10790](https://www.eurorad.org/case/10790)

**Clinical History:**
A 40-year-old woman came to our attention with rectal bleeding, no chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disorder and laboratory findings in range. Rectal digital examination detected a solid lesion in the left side of the rectal wall.

**Imaging Findings:**
The colonoscopy identified a polypoid lesion, located up to 4 cm from pectinea line, 3.5 cm in size, solid and easily bleeding. The biopsy was positive for extranodal marginal zone b-cell lymphoma of MALT type (CD20+, CD79a+, CD10+, CD5-). MRI showed a lesion 4 x 2.5 cm in size, located in the left side of the rectal wall, with regular margins, minimum infiltration of the mesorectum and homogeneous signal intensity: isointense on T1W, slightly hyperintense on T2W compared with adjacent muscle (Fig. 1). It showed contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1W (Fig. 2). On DWI (b value 800) it was hyperintense and hypointense on ADC Map (Fig. 3). One oval mesorectal lymph nodes, 10x6 mm in size, was identified. Total body CT examination did not show other sites of pathology. The bone-marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Tumour stage, according to Ann Arbor system modified by Musshoff: I

**Discussion:**
Primary rectal lymphoma is a rare disorder: 0.1-1% of all primary rectal tumours [1]. It is prevalent in male patients between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Possible risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease, immune-suppression and pelvic irradiation. Clinical presentation in the majority of cases is nonspecific and it can be comparable with rectal carcinoma, including; anorexia, weight loss, rectal bleeding, tenesmus and palpable mass [2].Rectal lymphomas are predominantly of the non-Hodgkin type that are classified by WHO into some different subtypes: diffuse large b-cell (60%), extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT]) (15%), Burkitt (15%), peripheral T cell, mantle cell and follicular cell. There are two types of MALT-lymphoma: the first one is …

### Relevant Case 1: #11253  ★★★★★ (5/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/11253](https://www.eurorad.org/case/11253)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Homogeneous rectal mass with marked diffusion restriction and minimal invasive behavior, typical for rectal lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This case shows classic MRI features of rectal B-cell lymphoma—bulky homogeneous mass, well-defined margins, concentric wall thickening and diffusion restriction—which directly parallels the imaging phenotype of the target MALT lymphoma and supports lymphoma over adenocarcinoma or GIST.

**Clinical History:** A 69-year-old male patient presented with symptoms of diarrhoea of 6 months or longer and constitutional syndrome. The colonoscopy identified an oedematous mucosa covered with fibrin; located 5 cm from anus and it was unable to progress distally.

**Imaging Findings:** MRI showed bulky ovoid mass, homogeneous and well-defined margins involving pelvis and lower abdomen. The tumour appeared to arise from a diffuse concentric thickening of rectum and extended inferiorly to 6 cm of the anal margin. The mass also abutted and compressed bladder and prostate without infiltration, therefore extended superiorly encasing inferior mesenteric vessels.No enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes were identified in the pelvic MRI. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes were observed on …

**Final Diagnosis:** B-cell lymphoma of the rectum.

### Relevant Case 2: #10587  ★★★★★ (5/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/10587](https://www.eurorad.org/case/10587)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Diffuse, homogeneous concentric rectal wall thickening with limited mesorectal infiltration.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Demonstrates primary rectal B-cell lymphoma with extensive homogeneous concentric thickening and limited mesorectal invasion, reinforcing MRI patterns that help differentiate lymphoma from more heterogeneous rectal malignancies.

**Clinical History:** A 77-year-old male patient consulted us for tenesmus and diarrhoea with 2 months of evolution. Without general syndrome. Sister with colon cancer history. At physical examination identified a lump of 3-4 cm of the anal margin that occupied 3/4 parts of the circumference. Laboratory studies were normal.

**Imaging Findings:** The colonoscopy showed a neoformation from pectinea line up to 12 cm. Endorectal echography demonstrated a tumour from anal margin with circumferential growth. Grease affection was seen.Thoraco-abdominal CT confirmed a mural thickening of the rectum, with nodular edges below the rectosigmoid union with longitudinal length of 6 cm and projection to mesorectal grease on the left side. Some small lymph nodes in path of the inferior mesenteric artery and right iliac primitive chain. No evidence of d…

**Final Diagnosis:** Primary rectal lymphoma type B-cell

### Relevant Case 3: #15471  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/15471](https://www.eurorad.org/case/15471)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Low T2 signal and no contrast enhancement, arguing against lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Although not lymphoma, this case is relevant as a key imaging mimic. The lack of enhancement, low T2 signal and absence of diffusion restriction help exclude lymphoma and highlight important negative imaging criteria.

**Clinical History:** A 52-year-old asymptomatic female patient with no significant past medical history presented for a routine colonoscopy screening. During the colonoscopy a submucosal lesion was detected on the anterior wall of the middle rectum. No biopsy was done at the time and an MRI was requested for further investigation.

**Imaging Findings:** MRI depicts a 3 cm submucosal lesion on the anterior wall of the rectum, located 8.5 cm from the anal verge. The lesion has circumscribed smooth margins with intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images (Fig. 1), low-signal on T2-weighted images (Fig. 2a, 2b) and low-signal intensity on diffusion weighted imaging with high b-value (Fig. 3). Intravenous gadolinium post contrast study revealed no contrast uptake (Fig. 5). An endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was sug…

**Final Diagnosis:** Endometriosis

### Relevant Case 4: #16138  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/16138](https://www.eurorad.org/case/16138)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Intrinsic high T1 signal from melanin, not seen in lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Provides a useful differential comparison. Anorectal melanoma can show diffusion restriction but is distinguished by intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and low T2 signal, features absent in rectal MALT lymphoma.

**Clinical History:** A 83-year-old man was referred to our institution complaining of painless rectal bleeding and a protruding mass during defecation. Digital rectal examination confirmed a friable soft tissue mass. Clinical history and remainder physical examination were unremarkable. Blood investigation revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was within the normal range.

**Imaging Findings:** Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a solid, homogeneous and hypoechoic tumour in the anorectal junction (Fig.1). Due to the patient's painful, it was not possible to cross the tumour with the probe. The tumour invaded the submucosa, but no muscular invasion or mesorectal lymph node metastases were observed.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed for further characterization and local staging, confirmed a solid polypoid lesion in the anorectal junction. The hypointense line correspondin…

**Final Diagnosis:** Primary anorectal melanoma

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Homogeneous GI wall involvement with preserved surrounding fat planes, characteristic of MALT lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Although located in the stomach, this case illustrates classic MALT lymphoma behavior—homogeneous wall thickening and preserved fat planes—which is conceptually and pathophysiologically analogous to rectal MALT lymphoma.

**Clinical History:** A 75-year-old woman presented with increasing stomach pain, bloating and nausea during the past two months. No fever, night sweats or weight loss was observed. At clinical presentation, a 6-7 cm mass was palpated in the right upper abdomen. No evidence of suspicious lymph nodes at clinical examination.

**Imaging Findings:** Figures 1, 2 and 3: Diffuse and homogeneous gastric wall thickening in the distal part of the stomach. The surrounding fat plane is preserved. Infiltration of adjacent organs is not seen.Figure 4: Mainly resolved gastric wall thickening after chemotherapy.

### Case 10186  
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/10186](https://www.eurorad.org/case/10186)

**Clinical History:**
A 38-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with left quadrants abdominal pain. Past medical history was unremarkable.Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness. Laboratory tests were abnormal with leukocytosis and the patient was febrile.Abdominal ultrasound and CT were performed.

**Imaging Findings:**
Transverse and longitudinal sonograms of the left flank show a hypoechoic lesion with no vascularization and adjacent hyperechoic fat. The lesion presents a small anechoic (liquid) component.Enhanced axial CT examination demonstrates a well-defined hypodense mesenteric cystic mass, with fluid-fluid level due to different liquid contents (ranging from the attenuation of water to that of fat). There is adjacent fat stranding and peripheral enhancement.Complete surgical excision was performed.

**Discussion:**
When the radiologist sees a cystic abdominal mass the first step is to determine the organ of origin. If it does not arise from a solid abdominopelvic organ but from the mesentery or omentum the differential diagnosis includes lymphangioma, enteric duplication cyst, enteric cyst, mesothelial cyst and nonpancreatic pseudocyst [1].Mesenteric and omental cystic masses are uncommon lesions [1, 2]. The most common type of mesenteric or omental cyst is lymphangioma. Mesenteric cysts are located between the leaves of the mesentery, mostly of the small bowel. Omental cysts are located in the greater omentum or lesser sac [3].All types of mesenteric/omental cysts occur in children and young adults and usually do not occur in the elderly. They usually manifest as a large, painful abdominal mass [2].…

### Relevant Case 3: #19174  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/19174](https://www.eurorad.org/case/19174)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Multiloculated cystic mass with thin enhancing septa and mass effect on bowel.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Illustrates mesenteric lymphangioma with complications and enhancing septa, relevant conceptually but more complex due to obstruction and volvulus compared with the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 38-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a three-day history of gradually progressive, intermittent abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting, and reduced bowel movements. His medical history included schizophrenia, well-controlled with antipsychotic medication. He had no prior abdominal surgeries. An abdominal CT with intravenous contrast (portal venous phase) was obtained.

**Imaging Findings:** A large fluid-attenuating mass, composed of multiple confluent cystic lesions, was noted in the right lower quadrant and pelvis, extending into the right inguinal canal (Figure 1). The confluent cystic spaces showed internal densities of fluid, imperceptible walls, lobulated margins, and thin, smooth, enhancing septae (Figure 2). The lesion exerted mass effect on the bladder and adjacent small bowel loops (Figures 3a and 3b). Small bowel obstruction was evident, with prominent dilation of the je…

### Case 9232  
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/9232](https://www.eurorad.org/case/9232)

**Clinical History:**
2-year-old patient came to our attention for acute right-leg pain, palpable muscle thickening and walking impairment due to painful leg press-up referred after a mild effort.There was no significant clinical history.

**Imaging Findings:**
On admission, plain film revealed cortical bone sclerosis of right femoral diaphysis (Fig.1). Ultrasound showed an inhomogeneous mass, 8x3 cm on maximum diameter, placed into the deep muscle-layer of the thigh (Fig.2a,b). Lesion appeared well defined, quite squeezable using the US-convex probe with clear colour Doppler signals (Fig.2c,d). MR examination was performed: lesion appeared isointense in SE T1W images (Fig.3a), inhomogeneously hyperintense on STIR sequences (Fig.3b,c) with multiple signal-void areas on FFE T2W sequences (Fig.3d), after paramagnetic cm iv-administration a significant inhomogeneous enhancement was also achieved. Moreover, the involved muscle appeared replaced by the lesion rather than really compressed (Fig.3e,f). CT examination showed the diffuse cortical bone thickening better without any appreciable cortical breaks (Fig.4).Based on these findings, differential diagnosis of mesenchimal sarcoma could not be excluded, for this reason surgical biopsy was performed. Finally, artero-venous malformation was confirmed on histologic evaluation (Fig.5).

**Discussion:**
The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification, based on cellular features, subdivides vascular anomalies in vascular tumours and vascular malformations (simple or combined). Jackson et al classify haemangiomas, vascular malformations, and lymphatic malformations on the basis of vascular dynamics. Malformations with arterial components are considered high-flow lesions and those without arterial components are considered low-flow lesions.US is an essential, noninvasive tool used to examine superficial vascular lesions. Colour Doppler imaging permits analysis of arterial and venous flow and measurement of flow velocities, it also results in an important method for monitoring patients who have undergone therapy, but it is limited in the assessment of deep lesions…

**Clinical History:** A 45-year-old male patient presented with swelling in the left hand for 20 years. The swelling was initially small in size which gradually progressed in dimension over the years. The swelling was multi-nodular, soft, compressible and pulsatile with audible bruit. Dystrophic skin changes with ulceration and necrosis were present in the overlying skin.

**Imaging Findings:** On ultrasound evaluation, multiple tortuous anechoic tubular channels were seen with dilatation at few sites. On power Doppler application, complete colour filling of the tubular channels was seen with high velocity pulsatile arterial wave form and spectral broadening. This led to the provisional diagnosis of high flow arteriovenous type of peripheral vascular malformation (PVM).

**Clinical History:**
A 17-year-old male patient presented with a two-day history of periumbilical pain having migrated into the right lower quadrant, associated with vomiting and nausea. There was no previous abdominal surgery or other significant medical history. Blood tests revealed a moderately elevated C-reactive protein (15 mg/l), without leukocytosis.

**Imaging Findings:**
Abdominal sonography showed a hypoechoic tubular 6 mm blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant, adjacent to the caecum and consistent with a normal appendix (Fig. 1a). A second incompressive tubular structure was visualized in a slightly more cranial location, with a maximal diameter of 17 mm. This second structure contained hyperechoic air as well as hypoechoic debris (Fig. 1b). There were associated enlarged lymph nodes (not shown); no abscess or free air were seen.Intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was then performed, about two hours after oral contrast media administration, showing the second tubular blind-ending structure to be developed from a thickened terminal ileum, with stranding of the surrounding fat and multiple lymph nodes (Fig. 2a, b), consistent with an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. The appendix and the rest of the abdomen were normal (Fig. 2c).The anatomopathological examination showed acute inflammation, perforation and haemorrhagic changes of the Meckel's diverticulum (Fig. 3).

**Discussion:**
Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract [1, 2]. It is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct, which normally involutes in the embryologic period between 10-12 weeks of gestational age [3]. Meckel's diverticulum contains three intestinal wall layers, making it a true diverticulum. The mucosa may consist either of normal intestinal epithelium or of ectopic gastric mucosa (in 45-80% of cases), in rare cases pancreatic mucosa may be found [4]. The location is variable among individual patients, but the diverticulum's base is usually found 50-100 cm upstream of the ileocecal valve [1, 5]. Its lenght is up to 10 cm. Meckel's diverticulum is present in 2-3% of the general population, with no gender predilection, however, men…

**Clinical History:**
A 40-year-old woman with a known osteochondroma in the left distal tibial metaphysis consulted for a growing mass in the same ankle, with tenderness and posterior tibial nerve compression symptoms.

**Imaging Findings:**
Radiographs (Fig. 1) showed the osteochondroma and posterior noncalcified soft-tissue mass in the ankle. An ultrasound (Fig. 2) was performed revealing a solid soft-tissue mass, in close relationship with the posterior tibial nerve.MRI (Fig. 3) was performed showing an oval lesion within the Kager fat pad with intermediate to high signal intensity on T1W images and heterogeneous signal intensity on T2W images, with areas of both intermediate and high signal intensity. No high-flow vascular channels were noted. The mass showed diffuse contrast-enhancement. The lesion was adjacent to the posterior tibial cortex but not to the osteochondroma. There were no signs of medullary invasion. The posterior tibial nerve could be seen apparently entering the mass. This last feature suggested the possible diagnosis of a neurogenic tumour.Percutaneous biopsy of the lesion was performed and anatomopathological study revealed findings for an extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma.

**Discussion:**
Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES) is a highly malignant tumour, likely of neuroectodermal origin, included in the Ewing sarcoma family of tumours, which share a translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 22 (q24;q12) [1].When compared with its osseous counterpart, EES is relatively rare and usually affects young patients (mean age is 20 years) [1].Tumours are often large at diagnosis and rapidly growing. Clinical presentation depends on the location of the lesion, which most commonly affects the paravertebral region and the lower extremities. Metastases are common at presentation, lung and bone being the most frequent sites [2].Histologically, the tumour consists of undifferentiated small round blue cells, that usually contain glycogen. The tumour can be distinguished from other …

**Imaging Findings:** A 22 year old woman without relevant medical history presented with dry cough, left-sided pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath for several days. No fever was noted. On physical examination there were diminished breath sounds on the left side. Laboratory analysis on admission did not show any abnormal findings. Chest radiograph showed massive left-sided pleural effusion, atelectasis of LLL and a left parahilar-retrocardiac mass. Contrast enhanced CT demonstrated a left extrapulmonary para…

**Final Diagnosis:** Primary  extraskeletal Ewing��s sarcoma - primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) .

### Relevant Case 3: #10781  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/10781](https://www.eurorad.org/case/10781)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Small round cell neoplasm with CD99 positivity confirming extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** The case confirms imaging and pathological features of extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma but represents disseminated intra-abdominal disease, which is less directly comparable to the localized ankle presentation of the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 58-years-old man presented in our department with a few months history of fatigue and microcytic anaemia. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were negative.

**Imaging Findings:** A CT showed an abdominal mass not cleavable from the ileal loops; the patient underwent CT enterography with oral injection of iso-osmotic polyethylene glycol. It demonstrated a solid non-homogeneous lesion (6x5.5 cm) with hypodense areas and small gas bubbles inside, located in the right abdomen. The lesion appeared not cleavable from an ileal loop, but it didn��t cause bowel obstruction and upstream loops dilatation. Several implants, ranging between 5 and 30 mm, were widespread in the mesente…

**Final Diagnosis:** Extraskeletal Ewing��s sarcoma-primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET).

### Relevant Case 4: #17053  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/17053](https://www.eurorad.org/case/17053)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Large heterogeneously enhancing soft-tissue mass consistent with aggressive extraskeletal sarcoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This mediastinal case supports awareness of extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma as an aggressive soft-tissue tumor in atypical locations but offers limited anatomic or differential overlap with the ankle lesion.

**Clinical History:** A 27-year-old male patient presented with complaints of exertional dyspnea and dry cough for a duration of 2 weeks. History of loss of weight was present.

**Imaging Findings:** Scout film showed a right anterior mediastinal mass lesion with mild mediastinal displacement to left (Fig 1). Plain and contrast CT sections of thorax obtained at settings of 120kV and 160 mA showed a large heterogeneously enhancing lesion arising from anterior mediastinum towards right, with cystic areas and areas of blood density within (Fig 2, 3). Pleural contact and displacement of mediastinal structures to left was noted (Fig 4 ). Mild compression of superior vena cava by tumour was noted …

**Final Diagnosis:** Mediastinal extra skeletal Ewing��s sarcoma
