# Radiologist Case Review — Relevance Assessment

_Generated: 2026-02-22 14:42_  
_Cases in this document: 4_

## Purpose

This document contains a set of Eurorad cases and their AI-retrieved relevant reference cases. For each target case you will see:

- The full target case text (clinical history, imaging findings, discussion)
- A set of retrieved relevant reference cases with full text
- GPT-5.2's automated relevance rating and reasoning for each reference case

## Relevance Grading Rubric

Please rate each relevant case on a **1–5** scale:

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **5 — Highly relevant** | Same pathology, same organ/location, same imaging modality; imaging features directly mirror the target case and would strongly guide the diagnosis |
| **4 — Relevant** | Same pathology family or strong imaging analogy; provides meaningful diagnostic support even if minor differences in location or patient demographics |
| **3 — Partially relevant** | Related differential or useful contrast case; provides supporting evidence but would not alone drive the diagnosis |
| **2 — Weakly relevant** | Tangentially related; useful mainly for exclusion or academic comparison |
| **1 — Not relevant** | Different pathology, different mechanism; unlikely to help a radiologist reach the target diagnosis |

**Grading dimensions to consider:**
1. **Pathology match** — same diagnosis vs. differential vs. unrelated
2. **Imaging feature overlap** — do the key imaging findings align (signal characteristics, enhancement pattern, morphology)?
3. **Organ / location** — same site vs. analogous site vs. different organ
4. **Clinical context** — age, sex, presentation — do they overlap meaningfully?
5. **Diagnostic utility** — would seeing this case help a radiologist identify the target condition?

## Questions for the Radiologist

For **each case** in this document, please answer the following:

1. **Discriminating imaging features**: Which specific imaging features are most discriminating for reaching the correct diagnosis? (e.g. signal intensity, enhancement pattern, morphology, location)

2. **Image-reading necessity**: For this case, is direct image viewing essential — or is the written imaging findings text sufficient for a radiologist to identify the correct diagnosis? Please explain why.

3. **When images are essential vs. text is enough**:
   - *Cases where you must read the images*: What types of findings or diagnostic distinctions genuinely require looking at the actual images rather than reading the written report?
   - *Cases where imaging findings text is enough*: What types of cases can be reliably diagnosed from the written imaging findings alone, without viewing the images?

4. **GPT-5.2 reasoning check**: For each relevant case listed, does GPT-5.2's stated rationale correctly identify the key imaging link to the target case? Is the "most important signal" clinically accurate and meaningful?

5. **Your relevance rating**: Using the rubric above, assign your own 1–5 score for each relevant case. Note any disagreements with GPT-5.2's rating and explain why.

6. **Framework for relevance judgment**: What is your general framework for deciding whether a reference case would help a radiologist diagnose a new Eurorad case? Which dimensions matter most — pathology match, imaging modality, organ/location, clinical context, or something else?

_Please apply the questions above to each case below._

**Clinical History:**
The patient was referred by the GP to the ED for thoracic pain irradiating to the left arm.There were multiple cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, 7 pack-years, positive family history).A clinical question: Stenosis?

**Imaging Findings:**
Rare congenital variant: mono coronary originating from the non-coronary cusp.The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) courses from the right atrioventricular (AV) groove anterior of the pulmonary trunk to the anterior interventricular groove (prepulmonic course).The left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) courses posterior to the aorta from the right AV groove to the left AV groove (retro-aortic course).No interatrial "malignant" course. No acute angle takeoff, slitlike orifice nor an intramural segment. No significant coronary stenosis.

**Discussion:**
A. Multiple courses of anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) are known: retro-aortic, prepulmonic, transseptal and interarterial. [1]Of these four variants, only the interarterial course is a cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD), the exact pathophysiology is not elucidated, because a normal pulmonary artery is not likely to exert enough pressure to occlude an interarterial coronary artery. [2] Right ACAOS is more frequent than left ACAOS, but has a weaker association with SCD.An intramural segment, another associated anatomical variant, is probably the most predisposing factor to sudden cardiac death. [3]It is defined as a proximal segment of the coronary artery located in the 'media' of the aortic wall without an intervening adventitia. [4]B. Ischaemia (an…

**Differential Diagnosis:**
Mono coronary originating from the non-coronary cusp without malignant features (SCD)Right anomalous origin of coronary artery from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course without intramural segmentRight anomalous origin from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course and intramural segmentLeft anomalous origin of coronary artery from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course without intramural segmentLeft anomalous origin from opposite sinus (ACAOS) with interarterial course and intramural segment

### Relevant Case 1: #14073  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/14073](https://www.eurorad.org/case/14073)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Demonstrates how altered coronary dominance and retro-aortic supply can mimic or compensate for missing vessels, but lacks a single-ostium mono-coronary anatomy.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This case involves congenital absence of a coronary artery with compensatory superdominant supply, which is conceptually related to congenital coronary variants but differs from a true mono-coronary origin from a single ostium.

**Clinical History:** Case A: 57-year-old male patient presented with atypical chest pain. CT coronary angiography was performed to rule out significant coronary artery stenosis.Case B: 67-year-old male patient with chest pain and exertional dyspnoea. Positive treadmill test. Previous history of similar episodes.

**Imaging Findings:** Case A: Calcium score of 150 with predominant calcifications along the LAD. Complete absence of the left circumflex artery (LCX) with no vessel visualised in the superior aspect of the left atrio-ventricular groove. The RCA was superdominant giving rise to the PDA and PLV branches along with extension along the base of the heart to the inferior aspect of the left atrio-ventricular groove supplying the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Multilevel mixed plaques noted along the LAD without signif…

**Final Diagnosis:** Case A: Absent left circumflex arteryCase B: Absent right coronary artery

### Relevant Case 2: #4847  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/4847](https://www.eurorad.org/case/4847)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Benign anterior/prepulmonic course without slit-like ostium or intramural segment supporting non-malignant classification.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Shows a single-ostium coronary anomaly with an anomalous prepulmonic course and absence of malignant features, closely paralleling the benign course assessment required in the target case, though involving the RCA rather than a mono-coronary system.

**Clinical History:** A 57 year old, male, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and IGT, with stress-ECG showing abnormal findings, we found an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery.

**Imaging Findings:** A 57 year old, male, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and IGT, with stress-ECG showing abnormal findings underwent coronary CT angiography. The patient referred about three previous episodesof chest pain in last two years, once lasting longer than 15 minutes and with radiation to the mandible, always related to exertion. The patient had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years but hestopped at 45. Blood examination demonstrated abnormal lipids (LDL 170 mg/dl, HDL 30 mg/dl) and impaired g…

**Final Diagnosis:** Left CAD and left Valsalva sinus right coronary abnormal origin.

### Relevant Case 3: #16640  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/16640](https://www.eurorad.org/case/16640)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Interarterial course of the left main between aorta and pulmonary trunk as a defining malignant feature absent in the target case.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Provides a clear contrast case of a malignant interarterial course arising from a common origin, useful for differentiating high-risk ACAOS patterns from the benign configuration in the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 48-year-old patient with hyperlipidaemia and a long term history of stable angina pectoris was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of acute chest pain and dyspnoea. Initial ECG showed sinus bradycardia with no signs of ischaemia and the patient was admitted for further tests. Cardiac catheterisation and a cardiac CT were performed which revealed a rare coronary anomaly.

**Imaging Findings:** Initially the calcium scoring showed no evidence of coronary calcifications, with a resulting Agatson score of 0.CT angiography performed subsequently revealed a common origin of both right coronary artery (RCA) and left main trunk (LM), with both arising from the right sinus of Valsalva. There was an anomalous course of the LM to the left between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk (interarterial course). After the bifurcation of unusually long LM into its branches, the left anterior descending a…

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant course of LM with right coronary dominance

### Relevant Case 4: #11134  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/11134](https://www.eurorad.org/case/11134)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Slit-like opening and acute angulation at origin—key malignant signs not present in the target mono-coronary case.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Illustrates malignant coronary anomaly with slit-like ostium and acute angulation, serving as an important comparator to highlight which dangerous features are specifically excluded in the target diagnosis.

**Clinical History:** 60-year-old female patient with complaints of vague chest pain. No history of diabetes or hypertension. CT coronary angiogram was advised.

**Imaging Findings:** The total calcium score was '0'. The right coronary and left main coronary artery showed a common origin from left aortic sinus. Anomalous course of right coronary artery (RCA) noted anteriorly between aorta and main pulmonary artery (inter arterial course). RCA is small in calibre with slit-like opening and acute angulation at its origin. Posterior descending artery (PDA) arising from left circumflex artery (LCX) suggest left coronary dominance. Rest of the coronary arteries are normal in cours…

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant coronary anomaly of RCA with left coronary dominance

### Relevant Case 5: #5946  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/5946](https://www.eurorad.org/case/5946)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** RCA coursing between aorta and pulmonary artery, defining an interarterial malignant pattern.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Demonstrates a classic malignant interarterial RCA anomaly, relevant mainly as a differential exclusion rather than direct support for the target benign diagnosis.

**Clinical History:** The authors present a case of an aberrant right coronary artery (RCA) (interarterial or malignant type) at a 64-years-old patient, presented with symptoms of unstable angina. Image findings at64-multidetector CT coronary angiography are described.

**Imaging Findings:** A 64-year-old male patient was presented to our department for a 64-slices CT coronary angiography examination due to unstable angina. The patient was thoroughly informed about the examinationtechnique and gave oral consent. A 64-multislice CT scanner (Aquilion, Toshiba Co) and a Vitrea 2 version 3.9 workstation (Toshiba Co) were used for the examination and image post-processingrespectively. Right coronary artery originated from the left aortic sinus, from separate ostium from the left coronary…

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant or interarterial right coronary artery

### Relevant Case 6: #6587  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/6587](https://www.eurorad.org/case/6587)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Interarterial course with malignant potential emphasizing the absence of such a course in the target case.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Another example of malignant interarterial coronary anatomy, useful for comparison but not directly supportive of the benign mono-coronary variant seen in the target case.

**Clinical History:** Heavy smoker, anxious patient with a significant parenthood for CAD (his father died for a heart attack at 52 y/o) and hypertension (SCORE system 1% 10-years risk of fatal cardiovascular events) whopresented asymptomatic.

**Imaging Findings:** The patient underwent an echocardiography which turned out to be negative. A 64-slice cardio-CT was performed since his familiarity that depicted a malignant right coronary (RCA) anomaly origin and course. The RCA arose from the left coronary sinus and had an inter-arterial course. No other signs of coronary artery disease were found. Due to the potential malignancy of this coronary anomaly (CA) the patient underwent a stress-test which showed no signs of ischemic disease.

**Final Diagnosis:** Malignant inter-arterial right coronary artery anomaly.

### Case 10790  
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/10790](https://www.eurorad.org/case/10790)

**Clinical History:**
A 40-year-old woman came to our attention with rectal bleeding, no chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disorder and laboratory findings in range. Rectal digital examination detected a solid lesion in the left side of the rectal wall.

**Imaging Findings:**
The colonoscopy identified a polypoid lesion, located up to 4 cm from pectinea line, 3.5 cm in size, solid and easily bleeding. The biopsy was positive for extranodal marginal zone b-cell lymphoma of MALT type (CD20+, CD79a+, CD10+, CD5-). MRI showed a lesion 4 x 2.5 cm in size, located in the left side of the rectal wall, with regular margins, minimum infiltration of the mesorectum and homogeneous signal intensity: isointense on T1W, slightly hyperintense on T2W compared with adjacent muscle (Fig. 1). It showed contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1W (Fig. 2). On DWI (b value 800) it was hyperintense and hypointense on ADC Map (Fig. 3). One oval mesorectal lymph nodes, 10x6 mm in size, was identified. Total body CT examination did not show other sites of pathology. The bone-marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy. Tumour stage, according to Ann Arbor system modified by Musshoff: I

**Discussion:**
Primary rectal lymphoma is a rare disorder: 0.1-1% of all primary rectal tumours [1]. It is prevalent in male patients between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Possible risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease, immune-suppression and pelvic irradiation. Clinical presentation in the majority of cases is nonspecific and it can be comparable with rectal carcinoma, including; anorexia, weight loss, rectal bleeding, tenesmus and palpable mass [2].Rectal lymphomas are predominantly of the non-Hodgkin type that are classified by WHO into some different subtypes: diffuse large b-cell (60%), extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT]) (15%), Burkitt (15%), peripheral T cell, mantle cell and follicular cell. There are two types of MALT-lymphoma: the first one is …

### Relevant Case 1: #11253  ★★★★★ (5/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/11253](https://www.eurorad.org/case/11253)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Homogeneous rectal mass with marked diffusion restriction and minimal invasive behavior, typical for rectal lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This case shows classic MRI features of rectal B-cell lymphoma—bulky homogeneous mass, well-defined margins, concentric wall thickening and diffusion restriction—which directly parallels the imaging phenotype of the target MALT lymphoma and supports lymphoma over adenocarcinoma or GIST.

**Clinical History:** A 69-year-old male patient presented with symptoms of diarrhoea of 6 months or longer and constitutional syndrome. The colonoscopy identified an oedematous mucosa covered with fibrin; located 5 cm from anus and it was unable to progress distally.

**Imaging Findings:** MRI showed bulky ovoid mass, homogeneous and well-defined margins involving pelvis and lower abdomen. The tumour appeared to arise from a diffuse concentric thickening of rectum and extended inferiorly to 6 cm of the anal margin. The mass also abutted and compressed bladder and prostate without infiltration, therefore extended superiorly encasing inferior mesenteric vessels.No enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes were identified in the pelvic MRI. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes were observed on …

**Final Diagnosis:** B-cell lymphoma of the rectum.

### Relevant Case 2: #10587  ★★★★★ (5/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/10587](https://www.eurorad.org/case/10587)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Diffuse, homogeneous concentric rectal wall thickening with limited mesorectal infiltration.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Demonstrates primary rectal B-cell lymphoma with extensive homogeneous concentric thickening and limited mesorectal invasion, reinforcing MRI patterns that help differentiate lymphoma from more heterogeneous rectal malignancies.

**Clinical History:** A 77-year-old male patient consulted us for tenesmus and diarrhoea with 2 months of evolution. Without general syndrome. Sister with colon cancer history. At physical examination identified a lump of 3-4 cm of the anal margin that occupied 3/4 parts of the circumference. Laboratory studies were normal.

**Imaging Findings:** The colonoscopy showed a neoformation from pectinea line up to 12 cm. Endorectal echography demonstrated a tumour from anal margin with circumferential growth. Grease affection was seen.Thoraco-abdominal CT confirmed a mural thickening of the rectum, with nodular edges below the rectosigmoid union with longitudinal length of 6 cm and projection to mesorectal grease on the left side. Some small lymph nodes in path of the inferior mesenteric artery and right iliac primitive chain. No evidence of d…

**Final Diagnosis:** Primary rectal lymphoma type B-cell

### Relevant Case 3: #15471  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/15471](https://www.eurorad.org/case/15471)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Low T2 signal and no contrast enhancement, arguing against lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Although not lymphoma, this case is relevant as a key imaging mimic. The lack of enhancement, low T2 signal and absence of diffusion restriction help exclude lymphoma and highlight important negative imaging criteria.

**Clinical History:** A 52-year-old asymptomatic female patient with no significant past medical history presented for a routine colonoscopy screening. During the colonoscopy a submucosal lesion was detected on the anterior wall of the middle rectum. No biopsy was done at the time and an MRI was requested for further investigation.

**Imaging Findings:** MRI depicts a 3 cm submucosal lesion on the anterior wall of the rectum, located 8.5 cm from the anal verge. The lesion has circumscribed smooth margins with intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images (Fig. 1), low-signal on T2-weighted images (Fig. 2a, 2b) and low-signal intensity on diffusion weighted imaging with high b-value (Fig. 3). Intravenous gadolinium post contrast study revealed no contrast uptake (Fig. 5). An endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was sug…

**Final Diagnosis:** Endometriosis

### Relevant Case 4: #16138  ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/16138](https://www.eurorad.org/case/16138)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Intrinsic high T1 signal from melanin, not seen in lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Provides a useful differential comparison. Anorectal melanoma can show diffusion restriction but is distinguished by intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and low T2 signal, features absent in rectal MALT lymphoma.

**Clinical History:** A 83-year-old man was referred to our institution complaining of painless rectal bleeding and a protruding mass during defecation. Digital rectal examination confirmed a friable soft tissue mass. Clinical history and remainder physical examination were unremarkable. Blood investigation revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was within the normal range.

**Imaging Findings:** Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a solid, homogeneous and hypoechoic tumour in the anorectal junction (Fig.1). Due to the patient's painful, it was not possible to cross the tumour with the probe. The tumour invaded the submucosa, but no muscular invasion or mesorectal lymph node metastases were observed.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed for further characterization and local staging, confirmed a solid polypoid lesion in the anorectal junction. The hypointense line correspondin…

**Final Diagnosis:** Primary anorectal melanoma

### Relevant Case 5: #15210  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/15210](https://www.eurorad.org/case/15210)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Homogeneous GI wall involvement with preserved surrounding fat planes, characteristic of MALT lymphoma.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Although located in the stomach, this case illustrates classic MALT lymphoma behavior—homogeneous wall thickening and preserved fat planes—which is conceptually and pathophysiologically analogous to rectal MALT lymphoma.

**Clinical History:** A 75-year-old woman presented with increasing stomach pain, bloating and nausea during the past two months. No fever, night sweats or weight loss was observed. At clinical presentation, a 6-7 cm mass was palpated in the right upper abdomen. No evidence of suspicious lymph nodes at clinical examination.

**Imaging Findings:** Figures 1, 2 and 3: Diffuse and homogeneous gastric wall thickening in the distal part of the stomach. The surrounding fat plane is preserved. Infiltration of adjacent organs is not seen.Figure 4: Mainly resolved gastric wall thickening after chemotherapy.

**Final Diagnosis:** MALT lymphoma

### Case 19078  
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/19078](https://www.eurorad.org/case/19078)

**Clinical History:**
A 49-year-old premenopausal woman presented to the gynaecologist with complaints of a painful right breast lump, which had started two weeks before. She had no known history of significant medical conditions. The physician ordered a bilateral mammography (Figure 1) and a breast ultrasound (Figure 2).

**Imaging Findings:**
A mediolateral oblique tomosynthesis view of the right breast revealed a 7 cm asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant (UOQ) (Figure 1). Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic palpable mass (Figure 2) with indistinct margins and no vascularity. No suspicious axillary lymph nodes were shown. The breast lesion was assigned a BI-RADS 4C category, and a US-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (10G) was performed. The diagnostic workup was completed with contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) after the biopsy (Figures 3a and 3b), which demonstrated a 7 cm non-mass enhancement in the UOQ of the right breast.Histopathological examination revealed no evidence of malignancy. The tissue showed features consistent with sclerosing lymphocytic mastitis, including a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, collagenised stroma, and a thickened basal membrane.The findings were reviewed in a multidisciplinary team with pathologists, gynaecologists and radiologists. Although the initial imaging findings were highly suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 4C), retrospective analysis revealed that the clinical and imaging features were concordant with the pathological diagnosis. Upon further review of the patient��s history, there was no evidence of diabetes or autoimmune disease. However, laboratory tests showed chronic hyperglycaemia, with HbA1c values between 5.8% and 6.1%. She was referred to an endocrinologist and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which revealed glucose levels of 89 mg/dl at 0 minutes and 183 mg/dl at 120 minutes. Her BMI was 30.85 kg/m2.Based on these findings, a conservative approach was adopted, with dietary intervention aimed at glycaemic control. At the six-month clinical follow-up, she reported no pain or palpable lump in the breast. OGTT values had improved to 83 mg/dl at 0 minutes and 137 mg/dl at 120 minutes, with an HbA1c of 5.4%. Follow-up breast imaging one year after biopsy showed complete resolution of the focal asymmetry (Figure 4).

**Discussion:**
BackgroundLymphocytic mastitis is an uncommon fibroinflammatory breast lesion with an unclear aetiology [1�C3]. It is more frequently observed in patients with poorly controlled long-standing type 1 diabetes (also known as diabetic mastopathy) [1�C4]. Exogenous insulin administration may trigger inflammatory reactions in the breast [1,3]. Alternatively, the secondary autoimmune effects of the accumulation of glucose in the extracellular connective tissue are thought to induce an immune response [4] that could be a possible mechanism to explain the association of lymphocytic mastitis with type 2 diabetes, as reported herein. However, this illness has also been described in association with other autoimmune or endocrine disorders, and in patients without any such comorbidities [2�C4].Clinica…

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Normal contrast-enhanced MRI despite suspicious mammography and ultrasound findings.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Strongly relevant due to similar mammographic asymmetry, shadowing on ultrasound, benign biopsy with lymphocytic infiltration, and normal contrast-enhanced MRI, reinforcing benign lymphocytic mastopathy diagnosis.

**Clinical History:** A 62-year-old female patient complains of painless left breast lumps found during self-examination. She has a 40-year history of type 1 diabetes, undergoing insulin therapy for more than 20 years.No significant family or personal history of breast cancer is present.

**Imaging Findings:** Physical examination showed two stony hard, ill-defined and relatively immobile masses on the left breast.Mammography revealed focal asymmetric densities in the upper-outer quadrant of the left breast and some round calcifications. No skin thickening, nipple retraction or enlarged lymph nodes were depicted (Fig. 1).Ultrasound showed two areas of strong acoustic shadowing without definables masses in the left breast (Fig. 3).Ultrasound-guided core biopsy was performed, revealing stromal fibrosis …

**Final Diagnosis:** Diabetic Mastopathy

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Resolution of suspicious imaging after benign histology confirming diabetic mastopathy.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Shows ill-defined hypoechoic mass in the upper outer quadrant with repeated benign biopsies and eventual resolution, supporting conservative management and benign nature similar to the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 44-year-old Caucasian man with a history of long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type I came to our department complaining of a palpable lump in his right breast. When asked about familiar pathologic history he referred that his mother and a maternal aunt had premenopausal breast cancer.

**Imaging Findings:** Mammography shows a moderate density nodule with ill-defined contours in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast (Fig. 1, 2), that sonographically (US) reveals to be a hypoechoic nodule with indistinct margins, measuring 3 cm (Fig. 3). Since it was considered suspicious, moreover in a high-risk patient, we decided to perform a US-guided core-needle biopsy. Histologically, breast parenchyma was recognized with epithelial ductal hyperplasia, fibrous stroma and a moderate periductal inflammato…

**Final Diagnosis:** Diabetic mastopathy

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Demonstrates that diabetic mastopathy can coexist with carcinoma, emphasizing careful exclusion of malignancy.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Partially relevant as it highlights coexistence of diabetic mastopathy and carcinoma in situ, underscoring the need for biopsy; however, it differs from the target case which had no malignancy.

**Clinical History:** A 78-year-old female patient was referred to breast surgeon with a 2-month history of a 3cm painless mass in her left breast. The mass was mobile and not attached to the skin and chest wall. No axillary lymphadenopathy was detected. She has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 20 years and been put on insulin treatment for 10 years. She also had hypertension.

**Imaging Findings:** On mammogram, there was a focal asymmetry (fibroglandular density tissue over a confined portion of the breast) over the upper central part of her left breast (figure 1). No discrete mass, suspicious microcalcifications or architectural distortion were seen. There was also no abnormal lymph node in the ipsilateral axilla. The contralateral mammogram was unremarkable.Ultrasound examination was performed over the clinically palpable lesion at 11-12 o��clock of the left breast (figure 2) and showed…

**Final Diagnosis:** Ductal carcinoma in-situ in diabetic mastopathy

[https://www.eurorad.org/case/16604](https://www.eurorad.org/case/16604)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Infiltrative non-mass enhancement with restricted diffusion and lymphadenopathy distinguishing lymphoma from mastopathy.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Primarily useful as a contrast case illustrating imaging features of secondary breast lymphoma, helping differentiate from lymphocytic mastopathy rather than directly supporting the diagnosis.

**Clinical History:** A 78-year-old female patient underwent mammography and ultrasonography for characterisation of a painless lump on right breast retroareolar area. Her past clinical history included a low-risk B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rai stage 0) and hypertension. Her past surgical history included left breast tumorectomy for benign pathology.

**Imaging Findings:** Mammography revealed a global asymmetry on the right breast (Fig. 1). A central architectural distortion on the left breast was also noted in concordance with past history of left breast surgery.A complementary tomosynthesis in MLO projection highlighted the presence of the asymmetry described above (Fig. 2).Ultrasonography showed multiple irregular hypoechoic nodules with indistinct margins in the lateral and upper quadrants of the right breast, as a correlate for mammography findings (Fig. 3).…

### Case 9232  
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/9232](https://www.eurorad.org/case/9232)

**Clinical History:**
2-year-old patient came to our attention for acute right-leg pain, palpable muscle thickening and walking impairment due to painful leg press-up referred after a mild effort.There was no significant clinical history.

**Imaging Findings:**
On admission, plain film revealed cortical bone sclerosis of right femoral diaphysis (Fig.1). Ultrasound showed an inhomogeneous mass, 8x3 cm on maximum diameter, placed into the deep muscle-layer of the thigh (Fig.2a,b). Lesion appeared well defined, quite squeezable using the US-convex probe with clear colour Doppler signals (Fig.2c,d). MR examination was performed: lesion appeared isointense in SE T1W images (Fig.3a), inhomogeneously hyperintense on STIR sequences (Fig.3b,c) with multiple signal-void areas on FFE T2W sequences (Fig.3d), after paramagnetic cm iv-administration a significant inhomogeneous enhancement was also achieved. Moreover, the involved muscle appeared replaced by the lesion rather than really compressed (Fig.3e,f). CT examination showed the diffuse cortical bone thickening better without any appreciable cortical breaks (Fig.4).Based on these findings, differential diagnosis of mesenchimal sarcoma could not be excluded, for this reason surgical biopsy was performed. Finally, artero-venous malformation was confirmed on histologic evaluation (Fig.5).

**Discussion:**
The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification, based on cellular features, subdivides vascular anomalies in vascular tumours and vascular malformations (simple or combined). Jackson et al classify haemangiomas, vascular malformations, and lymphatic malformations on the basis of vascular dynamics. Malformations with arterial components are considered high-flow lesions and those without arterial components are considered low-flow lesions.US is an essential, noninvasive tool used to examine superficial vascular lesions. Colour Doppler imaging permits analysis of arterial and venous flow and measurement of flow velocities, it also results in an important method for monitoring patients who have undergone therapy, but it is limited in the assessment of deep lesions…

  - Image 6: SE T1W sequence: picture shows the isointesity lesion (when compared to adjacent muscle signal), scattered by irregular hyperintensity signal spots.
  - Image 7: Axial STIR sequence:  inhomogeneous aspect of the lesion with widely hypointense areas surrounded by high-signal intensity tissue.
  - Image 8: Coronal STIR sequence also shows the hypointensity cortical bone thickening (due to sclerosis by compressive effect of surrounding lesion) and hyperintensity signal by bone-marrow oedema.
  - Image 9: After iv cm-administration, axial SPIR T1W sequence. Similar inhomogeneous enhancement pattern is achieved: central areas remain with low intensity signal while peripheral zone shows remarkable enhancement.
  - Image 10: After iv cm-administration, sagittal SPIR T1W sequences. Multiple low intensity signal areas are recognised inside the enhancing tissue lesion.
  - Image 11: Axial FFE T2W sequence: picture well shows the inhomogeneous signal intensity mixed to serpentine black-hole spots area, likely due to haematic debris components.
  - Image 12: Plain film: cortical bone thickening on lateral side of proximal femoral diaphysis (arrow).
  - Image 13: Axial plane: cortical bone sclerosis results better appreciable (arrow).
  - Image 14: Sagittal reconstruction: picture shows the posterior cortical bone thickening, while no cortical interruptions are visible. Arrow indicates the bone sclerosis and the cortical pathway of an hypertrophic medullary feeding vessel.

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Serpiginous vascular channels with arterial and venous Doppler flow and muscle replacement rather than compression.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This case closely mirrors the target with a thigh-based vascular lesion showing prominent Doppler flow and MRI-demonstrated abnormal vascular channels infiltrating muscle, helping differentiate AVM from solid neoplasms.

**Clinical History:** An 18-year-old female presented to us with complaints of a swelling in the posterior aspect of lower left thigh and pain on walking for the past ten months. On examination, no obvious lump could be seen or palpated. No deformity, color change or local rise of temperature was present.

**Imaging Findings:** On ultrasound evaluation (Fig 1), a small hypoechoic lesion was identified in the posterior aspect of distal left thigh showing color uptake and arterial flow. Hyperechogenicity of the biceps femoris was seen suggesting fatty changes. The sciatic nerve adjacent to the lesion also appeared thickened. Hence, a provisional diagnosis of a partially thrombosed vascular malformation infiltrating distal part of sciatic nerve was made.On MRI study (Fig 2), few abnormal vascular channels were seen in the…

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** High-velocity low-resistance arterial flow on Doppler and MRI flow voids forming a nidus.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Although located in the foot and in an adult, this case clearly demonstrates classic high-flow AVM imaging features that are directly applicable to distinguishing vascular malformations from tumors in the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 53-years-old male was admitted to the orthopaedic consultation complaining of pain and paresthesias in the right foot. At the objective exam, a small mass was detected in the first interdigital space of the right foot, without cutaneous lesions. An ultrasound (US) was first done, and then a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

**Imaging Findings:** The ultrasound of the first interdigital space of the right foot showed, in the dorsal region, a crooked hypoechogenic lesion, in the plane of the metatarsal heads (Fig. 1). This lesion had codification on colour Doppler with aliasing, near the dependence of the dorsal metatarsal arteries of the Hallux (Fig. 2). In the spectral Doppler is possible to detect in the lesion a low resistance arterial flow, with a high-flow velocity �C the maxim of 274 cm/s (Fig. 3).In the MRI, the lesion presented a…

**Final Diagnosis:** Arteriovenous malformation

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Cortical thickening and erosions caused by intraosseous drainage vessels associated with AVM.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** This case strongly supports the target diagnosis by showing how high-flow AVMs can produce cortical bone changes and mimic aggressive bone pathology, similar to the femoral diaphyseal sclerosis in the target.

**Clinical History:** A 32-year-old woman came to the outpatient clinic presenting with a 5-month history of pain in the right ankle. There was not history of trauma. There were not physical examination findings.

**Imaging Findings:** Ankle radiography showed abnormal cortex of the fibula and tibia, with lytic lesions and cortical thickening; minimal laminar periosteal reaction without fracture and doubtful permeative pattern (Fig. 1).CT confirmed several cortical lytic punch lesions in the right tibia and fibula, particularly in its lateral side. The permeative pattern was not confirmed. (Fig. 2-4). Associating abnormal soft tissues, with an increased volume of: soleus, flexor hallucis longus, and posterior tibialis, extendi…

### Relevant Case 4: #15905  ★★★★☆ (4/5)
[https://www.eurorad.org/case/15905](https://www.eurorad.org/case/15905)

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Complete Doppler color filling with arterialized venous flow and MRI muscle infiltration.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Demonstrates classic ultrasound and MRI findings of high-flow peripheral AVMs with muscle infiltration, reinforcing the interpretation of Doppler and MRI features seen in the target case.

**Clinical History:** A 45-year-old male patient presented with swelling in the left hand for 20 years. The swelling was initially small in size which gradually progressed in dimension over the years. The swelling was multi-nodular, soft, compressible and pulsatile with audible bruit. Dystrophic skin changes with ulceration and necrosis were present in the overlying skin.

**Imaging Findings:** On ultrasound evaluation, multiple tortuous anechoic tubular channels were seen with dilatation at few sites. On power Doppler application, complete colour filling of the tubular channels was seen with high velocity pulsatile arterial wave form and spectral broadening. This led to the provisional diagnosis of high flow arteriovenous type of peripheral vascular malformation (PVM). Arterial supply of the PVM was from ulnar and radial arteries with venous drainage into cephalic and basilic veins. D…

> **GPT-5.2 Signal:** Intraosseous hypervascularity with cortical erosions and medullary signal voids due to high-flow shunting.
>
> **GPT-5.2 Rationale:** Shows extensive soft-tissue and osseous involvement from a congenital AVF, supporting the concept that high-flow shunting can cause bone remodeling, though the extent and anatomy differ from the target.

**Clinical History:** 14-year-old female with congenital swelling of the right upper limb, progressive over time, was operated twice in other institutions with no previous available records.

**Imaging Findings:** CT Angiography revealed extensive vascular malformation of the right upper limb with a dilated serpentine network of arteries and veins, multiple sites of anomalous communication, the largest at the level of the brachial artery and vein, with manifest dilated subclavian artery and vein. There was also involvement of the intraosseous vessels, with hugely prominent nutrient artery grooves at the metaphysis of multiple bones with extensive vascularization of the whole medullary spaces being filled …

**Final Diagnosis:** Upper limb  AVF with soft-tissue and osseous involvement
