      "reasoning": "Pineal-region mass in a 43-year-old man causing obstructive hydrocephalus, with biopsy confirmation and an excellent response to radical radiotherapy, is most consistent with an intracranial germ cell tumour (germinoma). Germinomas commonly occur in young adults (male predilection), produce obstructive hydrocephalus by aqueduct compression, are highly radiosensitive, and often show central engulfment of pineal calcification. Other options are less likely: meningioma is dural-based and uncommon in the pineal recess; dermoid shows fat components; tectal glioma is typically a pediatric indolent tectal lesion; pineoblastoma is a more aggressive pediatric tumour. Therefore D is the best choice.",

Reasoning: Pediatric age (7 years) and a large retroperitoneal/adrenal-region mass that is predominantly cystic/necrotic, vascular, displacing stomach/spleen/pancreas, encasing/compressing renal vessels with resultant severe hydronephrosis fits a neuroblastoma arising from the adrenal/para\u2011aortic region. STIR showed no fat (argues against liposarcoma). Desmoid tumours and NRSTS are typically solid fibrous/sarcomatous masses and far less likely to present as a large mixed cystic vascular lesion in this age group. Haemangioendothelioma is uncommon in this location/age. Medline/Eurorad case examples describe cystic neuroblastoma presenting as complex cystic suprarenal/retroperitoneal masses with internal vascularity, displacement/encasement of adjacent structures and causing ureteric obstruction.

This pattern is classic for chronic inferior calcaneal (Baxter) nerve entrapment producing denervation atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi, usually seen in association with plantar fasciitis. \n\nWhy not the others:\n- A (intramuscular lipoma): would appear as a discrete fatty mass within the muscle, not selective fatty replacement of the entire abductor digiti minimi with plantar fascia thickening.\n- B (isolated plantar fasciitis): explains the fascial changes but not the selective muscle fatty atrophy.\n- D (plantar fibromatosis): causes nodular superficial plantar fascial masses, not diffuse fascial thickening with muscle denervation changes.\n- C (Baxter's neuropathy associated with plantar fasciitis): this is essentially the same entity but less specifically worded than E; option E precisely describes abductor digiti minimi atrophy from Baxter neuropathy, which matches the images.\n\nTherefore the most likely diagnosis is E: abductor digiti minimi atrophy associated with plantar fasciitis (Baxter neuropathy: chronic inferior calcaneal nerve entrapment).",

Blood cultures grew Streptococcus anginosus and the clinical course is acute with very high CRP\u2014findings that favor an acute pyogenic (bacterial) spondylodiscitis from contiguous seeding by intestinal contents. Prior vertebroplasty is noted but the CT directly shows enteric contrast entering the paravertebral/epidural collections, making iatrogenic infection less likely. Tuberculosis and fungal infection are less likely given the acute presentation, imaging with oral contrast demonstrating enteric fistula, and positive blood cultures for S. anginosus. Therefore the most likely diagnosis is pyogenic spondylodiscitis (Streptococcus anginosus) due to intestinal perforation (option D).",

Reasoning: The lesion is a small, well-marginated, T1-hypo / T2-hyperintense, vividly enhancing parotid mass with restricted diffusion (ADC ~1.0 x10^-3 mm2/s) and a Type\u2011B time\u2013intensity curve (early peak enhancement with rapid washout). This combination (low ADC + rapid washout on dynamic contrast imaging) is characteristic of Warthin tumour and helps differentiate it from pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumour), which typically shows progressive/late enhancement (Type\u2011A curve) and higher ADC values. Acinic cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas are less likely given the small, well-circumscribed appearance, lack of perineural/nodal disease and the classic dynamic/ADC profile. Supporting literature/cases from the database (e.g. Eurorad case 11031) describe Warthin tumours with early intense enhancement and rapid washout and cystic/oncocytic features on imaging, consistent with this case.",

Mucocele or appendiceal tumour typically appear as well\u2011circumscribed, cystic/tubular low\u2011attenuation masses (often with mural calcification) and are usually more chronic; caecal diverticulitis would show primary cecal wall abnormality.

In children the most frequent pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, making option B the best choice. Brucellosis (A) is less likely in this acute setting and usually causes sacroiliitis without a frank sequestrum and large surrounding pyogenic abscess; option C is redundant/unclear; option D (genitourinary/abdominal source) is not supported by imaging; and E (sickle cell disease) requires relevant clinical history.
