[med_simple_agent] Response:
E. Pineoblastoma

Reasoning: Biopsy confirmed a WHO grade IV pineal-region tumour with high proliferative index (Ki‑67 >40%) and CSF positive for malignant cells (Chang M3). Clinical presentation with obstructive hydrocephalus and the need for craniospinal irradiation are typical for a high‑grade pineal parenchymal tumour. Other options are unlikely: germ cell tumour markers (AFP/HCG) were normal, dermoid would show fat/calcification, meningioma is extra‑axial/dural and typically different imaging, and tectal glioma is usually a low‑grade paediatric lesion.

[med_simple_agent] Response:
Answer: C

Reasoning: A well-defined, tendon-sheath–related mass in the carpal tunnel that is low–intermediate on T1 and predominantly low on T2 with inhomogeneous enhancement is most consistent with a localized tenosynovial giant-cell tumor (giant-cell tumor of tendon sheath). Ganglion cyst would be T2-bright with only rim enhancement; fibroma of tendon sheath is possible but tends to be smaller and more uniformly very low on T2 from dense collagen; nodular fasciitis and fibrous histiocytoma have different clinical behavior and signal patterns. The location around the flexor tendon and the described signal/enhancement pattern favor GCTTS.

Reasoning: The saccular descending aortic aneurysm with new periaortic gas/intramural air, effacement of the periaortic fat plane and CT demonstration of contrast extravasation into the upper GI tract indicate communication between the aorta and the esophagus/gastric region. Clinical deterioration with hypotension and surgery confirming the defect further support an aortoesophageal fistula (secondary to erosion of the penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer/saccular aneurysm).

Reasoning: A focal lung lesion in the posterior basal left lower lobe supplied by an anomalous artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta is classic for pulmonary sequestration. The systemic arterial supply (from the aorta) and inability to demonstrate normal bronchial/venous anatomy distinguish sequestration from pulmonary AVM (which is supplied by pulmonary arteries) and from other congenital cystic lesions.

[med_simple_agent] Response:
Answer: A

Reasoning: Multiple enhancing intradural extramedullary, sausage‑shaped lesions concentrated in the lumbosacral canal (filum/conus region), T2 hyperintense and intensely enhancing, without foraminal extension, are most typical of a myxopapillary ependymoma (intradural extramedullary ependymoma) with local nodules. Schwannoma/neurofibroma more commonly show foraminal/dumbbell extension or target/plexiform features and NF‑related multiple nerve sheath tumours would usually have additional intracranial/vestibular lesions. Drop metastases are unlikely given no intracranial primary. Pathology was not provided, so pick the imaging diagnosis: ependymoma.

Answer: D

Reasoning: In a young child the combination of a large, ill‑defined, predominantly cystic mass that is Doppler‑vascular and displaces/compresses adjacent retroperitoneal structures is most in keeping with a vascular pediatric tumor such as a haemangioendothelioma. Liposarcoma is excluded by absence of fat; desmoid and NRSTS are typically solid/fibrous rather than predominantly cystic and not markedly vascular; neuroblastoma is usually a solid adrenal/sympathetic chain mass with calcifications and a different age/presentation.

Answer: B

Reasoning: CT shows long-segment, circumferential, homogeneous hypovascular thickening of the 2nd–4th portions of the duodenum with mucosal fold effacement, bulky periduodenal/para‑aortic lymphadenopathy, biliary/pancreatic duct dilatation but no invasive behaviour — a pattern typical of gastrointestinal lymphoma. Endoscopic biopsy reporting B‑cell lymphoma further supports the diagnosis. Carcinoma would more often be focal, irregular, heterogeneous and locally invasive; the other options are less consistent with the imaging and biopsy.

Key imaging: 9-year-old with first seizure; CT: heterogeneous parenchymal lesion, mild vasogenic edema, high attenuation suggesting hemorrhage, bone scalloping. MRI: ill-defined right parietal lobe mass, superficial small clustered cystic areas reaching cortex with deeper white matter extension, evident meningeal involvement after contrast. DNET usually shows bubbly multicystic cortical lesion without edema/enhancement and long epilepsy history—unlikely. Ganglioglioma often well-circumscribed cystic with mural nodule and calcification, often temporal lobe and long seizure history; may not show meningeal involvement—less likely. Pilocytic astrocytoma usually posterior fossa or cerebellar in children; supratentorial examples less typical and show well-circumscribed cyst with nodule—less likely. Gangliocytoma is rare. PXA classically superficial cortical tumor in children/young adults, presents with seizures, may show cystic components, leptomeningeal/meningeal involvement and bone remodeling/scalloping; can have hemorrhage and edema.

Reasoning: Contrast CT demonstrates a clear defect in the ventricular septum with surrounding hypoenhancement consistent with acute infarction of the inferobasal septum — findings diagnostic of a postinfarction ventricular septal rupture (VSR). Associated high‑attenuation pericardial fluid and hepatic venous contrast reflux reflect the acute hemodynamic compromise, but the visible septal defect differentiates VSR from free‑wall rupture, papillary muscle rupture, aneurysm or aortic dissection.

[med_simple_agent] Response:
Answer: D

Reasoning: CT demonstrates duodenal rupture with oral contrast tracking through a fistula into a paravertebral/epidural collection and into the intervertebral spaces, indicating direct contamination of the spine from the GI tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus anginosus (gut/oral flora known to cause pyogenic abscesses). These findings are most consistent with pyogenic (bacterial) spondylodiscitis from intestinal perforation. Iatrogenic infection from prior vertebroplasty is less likely given the clear duodenal fistula with contrast into the spine; fungal or tuberculous etiologies are also less consistent with the acute presentation and positive S. anginosus cultures.

[med_simple_agent] Response:
Answer: A

Reasoning: Well-circumscribed, hypervascular parotid lesion with vivid enhancement and diffusion restriction (ADC ≈1.0 ×10^-3 mm2/s) is most typical of a Warthin tumour. Pleomorphic (benign mixed) tumours usually have very high T2 signal, higher ADC and progressive enhancement. Acinic cell or mucoepidermoid carcinoma are less likely given the benign-appearing margins, lack of perineural/ nodal disease and the characteristic low ADC/rapid enhancement pattern favouring Warthin.

Answer: E

Reasoning: Clinical acute right iliac fossa pain with rebound and mild CRP elevation plus CT showing an enlarged appendix (2 cm), irregular wall thickening and prominent periappendiceal fat stranding and small reactive nodes is classic for acute appendicitis. Mucocele or appendiceal tumour typically produce a cystic/dilated appendix or a focal mass and more chronic presentation; caecal diverticulitis would show cecal wall abnormality rather than an isolated inflamed appendix.

[med_simple_agent] Response:
Answer: C

Reasoning: Imaging shows circumferential (target sign) thickening limited to the right colon (caecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure) with ascites and pericolonic stranding, while the terminal ileum is spared. Stool cultures were negative and Entamoeba serology was positive; the colitis resolved on follow-up CT after treatment. The combination of right-sided colonic involvement, ascites, positive Entamoeba serology and radiologic resolution after therapy is most consistent with amoebic colitis. Other options (CMV, Crohn's, typhlitis, ulcerative colitis) are less compatible with the distribution, clinical context and response.

Reasoning: Imaging shows focal marrow signal abnormality of the right sacral ala with cortical destruction and a central low‑signal sequestrum plus marked adjacent muscle edema/collection (iliacus, psoas, obturator internus, gluteal muscles) and contrast enhancement—findings typical of pyogenic osteomyelitis with secondary soft‑tissue abscess. In children the common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. Brucellar sacroiliitis is possible with farm exposure but usually produces joint erosions/arthritic change rather than a sequestrum and aggressive adjacent soft‑tissue abscesses.

Reasoning: Rapidly growing purple eyelid nodule in an adult combined with positive neuroendocrine markers (NSE, synaptophysin, CD56) and epithelial cytokeratins (PAN‑CK, CK AE1/AE3) is characteristic of cutaneous neuroendocrine (Merkel cell) carcinoma. Other options are less likely: metastatic small‑cell carcinoma would typically show markers (e.g. TTF‑1) suggesting a pulmonary primary, neuroblastoma is a paediatric tumour, angiosarcoma shows vascular markers (CD31/ERG) and keratoacanthoma is a squamous lesion with different histology.
