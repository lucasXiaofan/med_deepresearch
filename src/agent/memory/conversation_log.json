They were charged with drug trafficking and transported to the US. Delcy Rodríguez, previously Vice President, became the acting president. Maduro's tenure was marked by economic crisis, disputed elections (e.g., 2024), international sanctions, and opposition claims of illegitimacy. Recent events include US military actions and political transitions, with figures like Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and Diosdado Cabello influential. Rodríguez has spoken of a 'new political moment' and hinted at releasing political prisoners.\n\n## SOURCES\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro  \n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Venezuela  \n3. https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/whos-really-running-venezuela-2026-01-13/  \n4. https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuelas-acting-president-touts-new-political-moment-hints-further-release-political-prisoners  \n5. https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cwy1x9vwn3dt\n"

Search the medical case database for similar cases to help inform your diagnosis.\n\n## Clinical History\nA 27-year-old nulliparous female came for her first antenatal scan at 32 weeks of gestation with no prior early antenatal scans. She presented with a bilobed abdominal contour seen externally as two distinct bulges with a central vertical depression. No earlier imaging had been done.\n\n## Imaging Findings\nAn ultrasound examination revealed a thin central septum partially dividing the uterus into two hemicavities. The amniotic sac was seen occupying both the uterine hemicavities. The foetus was viable, with the foetal abdomen and lower extremities seen in the right hemicavity, and the foetal head and upper extremities extending into the left hemicavity across the central septum (Figures 1 and 2). Nearly two-thirds of the placenta was implanted on the left side of the central septum, with the rest of it implanted on the anterior wall of the left hemicavity (Figure 3). No vascularity was detected in the uterine septum on Doppler ultrasound.\n\n## Images\n- Image 1: USG image showing a thin central uterine septum dividing the amniotic sac within two uterine hemicavities, with few loops of umbilical cord and part of a foetal lower limb seen within the right hemicavity, placenta implanted on the left side of the septum and another loop of the umbilical cord within amniotic fluid within the left hemicavity.\n- Image 2: USG image showing a thin central uterine septum dividing the amniotic sac within two hemicavities, with part of the foetal abdomen seen within the right hemicavity, placenta implanted on the left side of the septum and a few loops of the umbilical cord within amniotic fluid within the left hemicavity.\n- Image 3: USG image showing the left uterine hemicavity with anterior placenta and one of the foetal upper limbs.\n\n## Discussion\nA uterine septum is a congenital Müllerian anomaly where a fibrous or fibromuscular band divides the endometrial cavity partially or completely. It results from incomplete resorption of the medial walls of the fused Müllerian ducts. The septum is typically avascular and poorly distensible, which can impair implantation and placental development in pregnancy.\n\nIn a septate uterus, pregnancy typically occurs in one hemicavity, as the septum restricts expansion into both sides. In rare cases, pregnancy can continue despite placental implantation on the septum. Diagnostic pearls include a narrowed uterine contour with persistent midline echo and extension of the gestational sac across the septum. No vascularity was detected in the uterine septum on Doppler ultrasound.\n\n## Question\nBased on the clinical history, imaging findings, and discussion above, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n**Options**:\nA. Gravid bicornuate uterus with intercornual communication\nB. Gravid didelphys uterus with partial fusion\nC. Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation\nD. Gravid arcuate uterus with exaggerated indentation\nE. Gravid uterus with intrauterine synechiae or band\n\nSearch the medical database for similar cases involving uterine anomalies, septate uterus, or Müllerian anomalies in pregnancy. Then provide your final diagnosis with reasoning.",

This conclusion is supported by the following key findings:\n\n1. **Thin Central Septum**: Ultrasound revealed a thin central septum partially dividing the uterus into two hemicavities, characteristic of a septate uterus rather than a bicornuate uterus which would have a thicker, myometrial-based septum.\n\n2. **Avascular Septum**: Doppler ultrasound showed no vascularity in the uterine septum, which is typical for a septate uterus (fibrous/fibromuscular septum) but atypical for a bicornuate uterus where the septum contains vascularized myometrial tissue.\n\n3. **Foetal Extension Across Septum**: The foetus was positioned with its abdomen and lower extremities in the right hemicavity and head/upper extremities extending into the left hemicavity across the central septum, demonstrating that the amniotic sac occupies both hemicavities.\n\n4. **Placental Implantation on Septum**: Nearly two-thirds of the placenta was implanted on the left side of the central septum, with the remainder on the anterior wall of the left hemicavity. This septal placental implantation is a rare but recognized complication in septate uteri.\n\n5. **Bilobed Abdominal Contour**: The external presentation of two distinct bulges with a central vertical depression corresponds to the internal uterine anatomy.\n\n6. **Embryological Basis**: A septate uterus results from incomplete resorption of the medial walls of the fused Müllerian ducts during fetal development (failure of the third step of Müllerian duct development - septal resorption).\n\n**Differential Diagnosis Exclusion**:\n- **Bicornuate uterus (Option A)**: Would show a fundal cleft >1cm, external contour abnormality, and the septum would have myometrial echogenicity with vascularity on Doppler.\n- **Didelphys uterus (Option B)**: Would present as two completely separate uteri and cervices, not a single uterus with a central septum.\n- **Arcuate uterus (Option D)**: Shows only mild fundal indentation without a true septum dividing the uterine cavity.\n- **Intrauterine synechiae/band (Option E)**: Results from prior instrumentation/infection, appearing as thin, irregular bands rather than a congenital midline septum.\n\nThe case database confirms this diagnosis as Case number 19172, which has identical clinical and imaging findings with a final diagnosis of \"Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation.\"\n\n## SOURCES\nMedical Case Database Search Results:\n- Case number 19172: Exact match with the presented case, final diagnosis \"Gravid septate uterus with septal placental implantation\"\n- Case number 9850: Discussion of Müllerian duct anomalies including septate vs bicornuate uterus differentiation\n- Case number 16525: Bicornuate uterus case demonstrating different imaging characteristics\n- Case number 5700: Bicornuate pregnancy case highlighting fundal cleft >1cm as distinguishing feature\n- Case number 18774: Explanation of embryological development of Müllerian anomalies (septate uterus results from failure of septal resorption)\n"
