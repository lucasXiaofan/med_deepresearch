She had no known history of significant medical conditions. The physician ordered a bilateral mammography (Figure 1) and a breast ultrasound (Figure 2).\n\n\n### Question\nBased on the clinical history and imaging findings above, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n### Options\nA. Breast carcinoma\nB. Granulomatous mastitis\nC. Lymphocytic mastopathy\nD. Traumatic lesions\nE. Panarteritis nodosa\n\nPlease analyze this case and select the correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E).\nUse the research_tools.py script to plan your research, query the database, and submit your answer.\n",

The improvement of MRI techniques especially by using contrast media, is expected to improve the diagnostic accuracy.\n\n--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---\nWe present a 69 year old woman with a painful fixed lump growing rapidly at the upper outer quadrant of her left breast.  The lump appeared one month prior to examination after a car accident and was gradually expanded in diameter. Our  patient had no other complaints or clinical symptoms.She reported that when she was 22 years old she developed pulmonary tuberculosis manifested primarily  as pleural effusion. Aspiration was  treatment of choice.  She was asymptomatic ever-since.Physical  examination  revealed a palpable painful cystic mass, adherent to surrounding tissues and slightly tender with lobulated surface, approximately 10cm in diameter. An ultrasonographic scan was then requested.The ultrasonographic characteristics of the mass were hypoechogenicity, limited compressibility and distal sound enhancement. Purulent (ehogenic) contents were visible inside the cyst, which was bordered by thick hyperechoic ca",
