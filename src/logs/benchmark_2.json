She denied any relevant associated symptoms.\n\n\n### Question\nBased on the clinical history and imaging findings above, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n### Options\nA. IgG4-related breast disease\nB. Invasive ductal carcinoma\nC. Papillomatosis\nD. Mass-forming ductal carcinoma in situ\nE. Lymphoproliferative disorder\n\nPlease analyze this case and select the correct answer (A, B, C, D, or E).\nUse the research_tools.py script to plan your research, query the database, and submit your answer.\n",

The circumscribed nodule located in the upper outer quadrant was stable compared to previous mammograms. Galactography was performed because of the patient's symptoms and it demonstrated an intraductal filling defect which coincided with the dilated duct. On ultrasound, an intraductal mass was visible.Vacuum-assisted percutaneous biopsy (VAB) guided by ultrasound was performed with removal of the entire visible lesion. The histological result was benign papilloma. The patient did not undergo surgery and secretion disappeared. The subsequent check-up after 12 months was normal.\n\n--- DISCUSSION ---\nBreast cancer can manifest occasionally as a nipple discharge as unique symptom. However, in most cases, the discharge is due to a benign entity. Intraductal papilloma is one of the most common causes of unilateral and spontaneous discharge.Intraductal papilloma is part of a complex group of lesions which include intraductal papilloma, p",

Eight years prior, she had been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (cT2N0M0). After undergoing neoadjuvant chemo- and hormonal therapy, she had a tumorectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy.\n\n--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---\nThe mammography (Figures 1a-1b) showed a clear band of progressive cutaneous thickening compared to the older images (Figure 1c). This was confirmed with the ultrasound (Figure 2). The cutaneous thickening was most profound below the red-purple discolouration peri-areolar in the upper medial quadrant. The known scar after tumorectomy in the lower medial quadrant showed further shrinkage. No other new lesions were observed in the left breast. The MRI displayed a thick diffuse cutaneous hypo-intense band on the T1 (Figure 3a) and T2 (Figure 3b). The post-contrast images showed several nodular-enhancing lesions in the skin (Figure 3c and Figure 4). The largest was located under the discolouration. No suspicious lesions were found in the tumorectomy scar or elsewhere in the breast tissue. A specimen was taken with a cutaneous punch biopsy for pathologic anal",
