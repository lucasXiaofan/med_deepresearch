Laboratory investigation revealed anaemia and elevated inflammatory parameters. An abdominal radiograph was obtained revealing a staghorn calculus in the left kidney. An abdominal CT-scan was deemed necessary for further investigation.\n\n--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---\nCT scan confirmed the presence of a large staghorn calculus in the left renal sinus with accompanying frank caliectasis. The left kidney was significantly enlarged, measuring over 140 mm in longitudinal length. There was substantial cortical thinning and a delayed nephrogram. Two large hypodense collections were present in the anterior porting of the affected kidney, being partially attributable to frankly dilated calyces filled with calculi fragments and fluid.CT also revealed perinephric fluid and thickening of the pararenal fascias, with a striking thickening of Gerota��s fascia. Additionally, there was thickening and enhancement of the left ureter wall, with mild prominence of the ureteral calibre in all its course.Slightly enlarged oval-shaped later aortic lymph nodes with nor",

Routine laboratory test showed a reduced TSH level to 0.150 milli IU/L with normal T3, T4 and thyroglobulin level. CT examination of the neck was requested.\n\n--- IMAGING FINDINGS ---\nContrast enhanced CT neck was performed using a 16-slice spiral scanner (1.25mm collimation, 2.5 slice thickness, 2.7mm/s table feed, 3mm reconstruction), and showed large enhancing heterogeneous nodules in the thyroid region. Normal thyroid tissue could not be identified. There was consenting narrowing of the tracheal lumen. It was noticed that there were small pulmonary nodules in the apices of the lungs when CT neck was performed.An urgent Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration and needle core biopsy of the thyroid gland demonstrated follicular tissue with mild nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia and no changes of papillary carcinoma. This was interpreted as suspicious of follicular carcinoma, since vascular and capsular invasions cannot be assessed on needle core biopsy.Contrast enhanced 320 Omnipaque CT chest was don",
